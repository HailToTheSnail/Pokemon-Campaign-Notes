## Fakémon
- [Anvulcan](https://www.instagram.com/p/CF-aNcrjiYc/?epik=dj0yJnU9enlqV01sUjVXNEQ5cEdFLXQ2R3RwaDJEYVVQZnM4eGYmcD0wJm49MGZyU3VqcU9TaTlfSmUweGMwWUN5dyZ0PUFBQUFBR2JESGRr), the Forge Pokémon  - Steel/Fire
	- Living high in the mountains, this Pokémon devours coal to maintain its internal body temperature of about 2,000 degrees C. Any raw metal it chews on melts in its mouth under the extreme heat. This behavior, to many metallurgists’ delight, has been found to perfectly temper iron and steel.

## History
- **Chrovos:**
    - In Sinnoh mythology, the Sinnoh people depict Arceus as the first being and creator of the universe. That isn't entirely true
- **Kaiju Trio:**
    - While the legends in Sinnoh depict Arceus creating Azelf (willpower), Uxie (knowledge), and Mesprit (emotion) after the Creation Trio, the truth is that the Origin Pokémon created another trio of Legendaries before the Lake Guardians. A prototype to Emotion, Knowledge, and Willpower. Concepts less refined jammed into vessels incapable of holding such vast abstractions. Courage, Power, and Wisdom. Diphisra, Infernagon, and Gamera.
    - Incapable of returning the concepts of Courage, Power, and Wisdom to the Void, Arceus instead sealed the Kaiju Trio away within the earth, sky and water of present-day Indalo. Having learnt better, the Origin Pokemon then took a small fraction of the Kaiju Trio's power and created Azelf (willpower), Uxie (knowledge), and Mesprit (emotion) and
- **Earthbound Immortals (based on Nazca Lines):**
    - The Earthbound Immortals are six extremely powerful and dangerous Legendary Pokémon without sentience whose sole purpose is to maintain the seals that keep Chrovos from setting the Pokémon World aflame in chaos. They are sealed in geoglyphs across the Indalo region, some of which have been uncovered while others have been lost to time itself.
    - One of the Kaiju Trio awaken whenever one of the Earthbound Immortals are set free and act as wardens of sorts to the otherwise walking disasters that are the Earthbound Immortals.
    - They are based on the [Nazca Lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca_lines) in the Nazca Desert in southern Peru.
- **The Kingdom of Edria:**
    - The Indalo region used to be recognized as the Kingdom of Edria by the Edrians, the people of Elkia, before most of their history was lost to the ravages of time save for a few murals left in locations of importance to the Kaiju Trio.
