## Organizations
- The Aura Guardians are the remnants of an age long gone. Having been protectors of both humanity and Pokémon alike, they are the founding fathers of many of the greatest defense forces against evil such as Division (Nikita), Kingsman (Kingsman Franchise), and especially the Pokémon Rangers. The Aura Guardians of the current age are a small splintered organization that each work independently from one another.  They are all capable of Aura manipulation, and by extension molding Type Energy. They are extremely protective of their secrets after having witnessed the Lost Age and are wary of their Aura manipulation skills being used for evil. Nonetheless, they will do everything in their power to help both humans and Pokémon alike.
	- The Aura Guardians have a practice in order to properly teach and preserve the honor of their fellowship. It is called the Rule of Two. This means that an Aura Guardian will only ever take on one apprentice in their lifetime so that they can focus their entirety in teaching that one person and making sure that the knowledge and power they are passing down does not corrupt their apprentice.
	- The Aura Guardians are one of the few beings that know about what truly happened in the Lost Age which is passed down from generation to generation from word of mouth.
- The ancient civilization of Edrians were capable of manipulating Energy to a lesser extent than Pokemon. Pokemon guided humans back then on how to use Energy and were Masters in a sense. It was only thousands of years later that Pokémon became slaves to humans after they believed themselves superior due to human numbers. And since then, many humans forgot about their ability to mold Type Energy.
- The Kingsman Secret Service is a secret organization that works directly for the Crown. They function as secret agents that do everything in their power to keep Indalo safe. They are highly-trained agents with a partner Pokémon and each have code names based on the Knights of the Round Table.
	- All Kingsman agents are supported by two individuals known by the code-names "Merlin" and "Morgana" in reference to Merlin the Wizard and Morgana le Fay, who oversees the agency support staff, formulates field strategies, trains prospective recruits and provides technological/IT assistance as necessary.
	- Each Kingsman has a signet ring that identifies them as a Kingsman.
	- Each of the Kingsman are born off high society, save the one probationary member, Sir Gareth, who the party run into. He was taken off the streets by Sir Gaheris and given a chance to become a member of Kingsman.
		- Sir Gareth (22) loathes the snobbish attitude his peers have towards him due to his pedigree. He tolerates many of the insults thrown his way but will vehemently defend Sir Geheris if his character is slandered. He sees Sir Gaheris as the only family he has and wants to make him proud by proving his worth to the Kingsman Agency. However, he would forsake the mission if it meant keeping Sir Gaheris safe.
## NPCs
- Kamille has become Instagram famous.
- Garibaldi - strongest trainer or Fakemon (on par with Bidoof)
	- "I am inevitable."
- Character that was created by Providence for the single purpose of being 
	- Every action he made wasn't by his own choice but by Providence.
		- In the end, he makes the choice to sacrifice his life in order to put to rest an Earthbound Immortal or Chrovos.

## Fakémon
- [Anvulcan](https://www.instagram.com/p/CF-aNcrjiYc/?epik=dj0yJnU9enlqV01sUjVXNEQ5cEdFLXQ2R3RwaDJEYVVQZnM4eGYmcD0wJm49MGZyU3VqcU9TaTlfSmUweGMwWUN5dyZ0PUFBQUFBR2JESGRr), the Forge Pokémon  - Steel/Fire
	- Living high in the mountains, this Pokémon devours coal to maintain its internal body temperature of about 2,000 degrees C. Any raw metal it chews on melts in its mouth under the extreme heat. This behavior, to many metallurgists’ delight, has been found to perfectly temper iron and steel.
- [Drageraph](https://ca.pinterest.com/pin/433893745359347387/), the Angel Pokémon - Dragon/Fairy
	- Drageraph are the true evolution of Dragonair and are a rare and beautiful sight to behold. It is said that if you see this Pokémon flying overhead, you will live a long and prosperous life.
- [Fairen](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5LS4TzihCp/?epik=dj0yJnU9RXNWanZaTE9qbm5qWkNJczljQ2FFeFoweTBKb0RvQzYmcD0wJm49c1lHbzJfWkZXeHhQX1YxcU9QQmUyZyZ0PUFBQUFBR2JES01B&img_index=1), the Heavenly Pixie Pokémon Fairy/Steel
	- These Pokémon, despite their cute and cuddly appearance, love to fight, even with Pokémon that are much bigger than them. They are very rare but can be easily found on the highest peaks of the region.
- [Falhalla](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5Nyw0TIQpE/?epik=dj0yJnU9cnZEMHJfdE5jSncyRHF5S1BnY2V1QWtrc1gzRVdZMmQmcD0wJm49RndUelNmRk9PQnBIZXlQYXNGSllyQSZ0PUFBQUFBR2JES0x3&img_index=1), the Blade Pokémon - Fairy/Steel
	- These Pokémon are very fast and combative. It is said that the blade on their arm is so sharp and resistant, that it can even cut through large trees or rocks in the blink of an eye.
- [Valkirien](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5QarepISB1/?epik=dj0yJnU9eW04d2VydUdCa1RVTlZhS1kwWk5LZnBHTFBoWE1FSUMmcD0wJm49R0JqdEJRaXoxWGswdHJkdnJwamN3USZ0PUFBQUFBR2JESkk4&img_index=1), the Sky Paladin Pokémon - Fairy/Steel
	- The legends of Indalo say that these Pokémon guarded the very entrance to the Hall of Origin where Arceus slumbers. Despite their elegant appearance, this lethal Pokémon defends themselves and those they serve against attacks using the shield and then pierce their opponent with the sword attached to their other arm.
- [Substicute](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5d1114680bdedd988e40540277e88b1d/tumblr_prtxq8AcPn1x03r8vo1_500.png), the Substitute Pokémon - Normal/Ghost
	- This Ghost-Type Pokémon often possesses the Pokémon dolls of little kids in order to experience what it feels like to be loved and cared for. However, this behavior often leads to Substicute scaring the children and leaving the Ghost-Type more emotionally scarred than they were before. This vicious cycle continues for the Substicute until they find a kid to be their friend or wither away when experiencing enough trauma.
- Inkalf, the Shadow Pokémon - Dark/Ghost
	- This Pokémon is extremely skittish and is easily frightened, even by their own shadow which they have yet to master in their young age. Inkalf are rather defenseless in this stage of their life and stay with their parents and the herd until they are capable of defending themselves or have evolved. The Shadow Pokémon migrate twice a year across the \[Insert African region name] region.
- Okapypaste, the Shadow Pokémon - Dark/Ghost 
	- These Pokémon are capable of manipulating their own shadows, often draping them around their bodies or forming fake heads to scare off would be predators. They rely on the darkness casted by rainforest canopies to thrive. Due to illegal poaching of their shadow ink, the Okapypaste have been hunted to near extinction. Humans have created breeding centers in order to help repopulate the Shadow Pokémon numbers.
- [Buneary Doll Forme](https://www.projectazurite.com/kurian-buneary), the Rabbit Pokémon - Ghost/Normal
	- Some Buneary are taken from the world too young and some refuse to accept their fate. This leads them to possess Buneary Dolls that are found in the Kuria region. These Buneary are quite lonely, since people are naturally afraid of a plush that just came to live all of the sudden. Buneary simply wishes to find a Trainer to take care of it and love it so that it can live the life of a normal Buneary.
- [Lopunny Doll Forme](https://www.projectazurite.com/kurian-lopunny), the Rabbit Pokémon - Ghost/Normal
	- After evolution, the plush body and the soul are completely linked due to the affection of its Trainer. In this form, it'll do whatever it can do make its trainer proud of it. It's very thankful for the affection it had received as a Buneary, so it feels like it is forever in your favor. This is especially apparent in battle, where Lopunny sometimes loses focus to see if the Trainer is happy with its performance. However, not all is as happy as it seems. While the soul and body are truly linked again, the soul also becomes corrupt over time. As much as a second chance at life sounds good, it's not meant to be. Because of this corruption, it can be very sadistic to the extent that it can accidentally horrify the being it's supposed to impress.
- [Lopunny Mega Doll Forme](https://www.projectazurite.com/mega-klopunny), the Rabbit Pokémon - Ghost/Fighting
	- While plenty of Mega Evolutions have some grueling side effects, the Mega Evolution of Kopunny Doll Forme is by far the most disturbing. When the behavior of this terrifying Mega Evolution was studied by Professor Sycamore, he found out that during the process, Lopunny re-experiences the time it passed as a normal Buneary. The realization and denial corrupts the soul to a horrifying extent. It forces Lopunny to think that it needs to fight viciously to survive and that its opponents want it dead. It takes an extremely capable Trainer to make sure that Lopunny Mega Doll Forme doesn't go too far or hurt itself, let alone others. As long as it has a Trainer it can depend on, Lopunny is less likely to get unstable.
- [Crystal Starmie](https://www.projectazurite.com/crystal-starmie-1), the Mysterious Pokémon - Water/Psychic
	- Rumor has it that there exists a Crystal Onix somewhere in the Orange Islands, but no one has ever seen head or tail of it. The first true crystal Pokémon to be seen was the Crystal Starmie which made its debut in a showmatch when Gym Leader Malenia returned from her vacation to Kanto. Many people have tried to learn about where Malenia found the Crystal Starmie, but she has admitted that it was the Mysterious Pokémon that found and not the other way around. It has been stated that the Crystal Starmie, if ever sold, would go for nearly a billion Pokédollars.
- [Shadow Lugia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Shadow_Lugia) , the Diving Pokémon - Psychic/Flying (Lara/XD001)
	- Lara was a young Lugia that was infected by the Negative Taint. She was captured at a young age, which was the reason for the natural destruction of numerous coastal cities at the hands of the mother Lugia. Caught by Cipher, they raised the Lugia in a lab where they were the first test subject of Project Shadow. A slave to Cipher, Lugia unwillingly did their bidding, robbed of their freedom and putting up a futile resistance. Eventually, Lara was freed from Cipher by Michael. Despite this, after nearly half a decade, the Lugia was captured once again by Providence.
- [Hollow](https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Knight) - UB Knight, the Vessel Pokémon - Ghost/Dark
	- Hollow are Ultra Beasts that  live in another world known as Hallownest. They are the discarded Vessels, beings of the Void, created by the Pale King as a means of stopping the Infection, an ancient sickness that led to the deaths of thousands of bugs and ultimately the ruination of the kingdom of Hallownest. Unworthy and incapable of achieving the goals set by the Pale King, these unwanted Vessels are left to wander the depths of the Abyss for eternity.
- Pokémon with a missing eye that player catches gets a glass eye and bobs head left and right whenever they are going to attack to get a better depth perception for an attack on a target.
- Strong non-Legendary Pokémon that has the ability Desolate Land or Primordial Sea.

## Abilities
- **Gravity Down:** At the start of each turn, it pulls every Pokémon down to the ground, reducing the foe's Speed stat by one. Pokémon cannot flee or switch. In addition, Flying-Type Pokémon or Pokémon with the Ability Levitate, lose their Immunity to Ground-Type Moves. Flying-Type Moves have no effect while this Pokémon is on the field.
- **Spectral Grasp:** Physical Moves have a 30% chance to disable the opponent's last used Move for 2 turns.

## Terminology
 - Everyone has Aura (the ability to manipulate Type Energy) and a natural affinity to a certain Type. While everyone has Aura, the majority of people are incapable of molding their Aura into Type Energy. This is because the practice of molding Aura into Type Energy has been lost to humanity since the events of the Lost Age. The few that can mold Type Energy have either practiced molding their Aura into Type Energy, thus increasing their reserves, or were naturally born with large reserves, thus making them capable of forcefully molding their Aura into Type Energy.
	 - Many of the greatest trainers know how to mold Aura into Type Energy, and often learn of this phenomenon throughout their journey. This elevates them to a level where they better understand their Pokémon, and therefore are far more capable as trainers.

## History
- **Chrovos:**
    - In Sinnoh mythology, the Sinnoh people depict Arceus as the first being and creator of the universe. That isn't entirely true as Chaos, or better recognized as Chrovos, was a being that exceeded the universe and was the first being that created Arceus itself.
    - Arceus sealed Chrovos away after they had created Earth, Pokemon, and Humans, and Chrovos existence wished for the end of life in its chaos
    - Alternatively,  Chrovos represents the Void, the living embodiment of the absence of everything, which led to Arceus sealing Chrovos when the Origin Pokemon wished to create life.
- **Kaiju Trio:**
    - While the legends in Sinnoh depict Arceus creating Azelf (willpower), Uxie (knowledge), and Mesprit (emotion) after the Creation Trio, the truth is that the Origin Pokémon created another trio of Legendaries before the Lake Guardians. A prototype to Emotion, Knowledge, and Willpower. Concepts less refined jammed into vessels incapable of sustaining such vast abstractions. Courage, Power, and Wisdom. Diphisra, Infernagon, and Gamera.
    - Incapable of returning the concepts of Courage, Power, and Wisdom to the Void, and afraid of the consequences, Arceus instead put the Kaiju Trio into a deep slumber within the earth, sky and water of present-day Indalo. 
    - The Kaiju Trio were the gatekeepers of the Earthbound Immortals, seven extremely dangerous Legendary Pokemon who maintained the seals that kept Chrovos from escaping and sewing chaos across the Pokemon World.
    - Having learnt better, the Origin Pokemon used the Kaiju Trio as a template for Azelf (willpower), Uxie (knowledge), and Mesprit (emotion) which were Pokemon capable of quelling the rage of the Creation Trio.
- **Earthbound Immortals (based on Nazca Lines):**
    - The Earthbound Immortals are seven extremely powerful and dangerous Legendary Pokémon without sentience whose sole purpose is to maintain the seals that keep Chrovos from setting the Pokémon World aflame in chaos. They are sealed in geoglyphs across the Indalo region, some of which have been uncovered while others have been lost to time itself. Only six are known to history thought lost in the Lost Age, while a seventh exists that only a Kaiju could reveal.
    - One of the Kaiju Trio awaken whenever one of the Earthbound Immortals are set free and are wardens to the otherwise walking disasters that are the Earthbound Immortals.
    - They are based on the [Nazca Lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca_lines) in the Nazca Desert in southern Peru.
- **The Continent of Edria:**
    - The Indalo region used to be recognized as the Continent of Edria by the Edrians, the people of Edria, before most of their history was lost to the Lost Age save for a few temples and murals left in locations of importance to the Kaiju Trio.
- **The Lost Age:**
	- The Lost Age is a period of time with almost no recorded archaeological history. The events of this period are so important and relevant that by learning them, one is said to become capable of destroying the world. 
		- The Lost Age depicts a period of time in which people became aware of the Earthbound Immortals and a being of power higher than Arceus itself. Many people sought to make Chrovos' power there own and started freeing the Earthbound Immortals. Chaos was sewn across the Indalo Region and massive wars were fought by kings and queens racing for Chrovos' power.
			- Chrovos' existence and power started spreading to humans, being who were capable of corruption, through dreams of them appearing as an infinite nebula of chaos (Works similar to the Radiance's).
			- In the modern day, Chrovos' nebula touched the mind of Arthur Fontaine, and later, Giovanni Sakaki, influencing the two to pursue their power and free Chrovos, which led to Arthur Fontaine perceiving a hidden weapon within the Indalo Region and Giovanni to betray the Partners.
		- In the end, Arceus forced an end to conflict with the help of the Aura Guardians, a group of humans capable of tapping into the life essence that each Pokemon is born with, slaying the many rulers that incited the conflict and destroying any historical piece of evidence that mentions the Earthbound Immortals and Chrovos themselves. 
			- The Aura Guardians then split up and traveled to set up bases across all regions in order to better protect the world as a whole. Almost every organization that fights the evil of the Pokemon World can draw their roots all the way back to the Aura Guardians: Aura Guardians, Division (Nikita), Kingsman (Kingsman Franchise), and the Pokemon Rangers.
		- The beings that know of the Lost Age are Arceus, the Creation Trio, most of the Legendary Pokémon, some of the oldest Dragon-Type Pokémon, a select few long-lived Pokémon, and the Aura Guardians.
- **Lost Christmas:** 
- **Hour of Joy:** 
- **The Nihility:**
## Locations
- Sky Kingdom - Kingdom in the sky in which humans continued to co-exist with Pokémon and therefore continued to cultivate their talents with molding Type Energy under the guidance of Pokémon. This is something only a few humans on the Surface are capable of due to losing this gift after trying to seize the power for themselves from the Pokémon. Due to their smaller population, they have retained the old ways and have relied on molding Type Energy to survive instead of technological evolution.

## Quests
- Pokemon Center Escape - Party feel safe in the Pokemon Center room but then the Pokemon Center is attacked by Providence. They have no Pokemon and need to escape downstairs to get their Pokeballs.
