## Description
Rattata are common Pokémon, often found in the fields and urban areas of many regions. They live in large groups of 40 to 50 members, and are almost never separated; if one finds a Rattata dwelling in their home, it is certain that there are dozens more hiding around as well. 
They can be a nuisance, as they eat nearly anything and are extremely quick, seemingly unable to stay still for long periods of time. If a Rattata locates food, it will call upon its group-mates to join it. They will then settle in the area and reproduce continuously. 
In addition to consuming ​large amounts of food, Rattata also pack a vicious bite. They can potentially pass diseases through puncture wounds. Their teeth never stop growing, so they must constantly gnaw on hard objects to whittle them down or risk starvation, unable to close their mouths. They often use manmade objects such as telephone poles for this purpose. All this together makes Rattata huge household pests, so many employ Pokémon like Meowth and Glameow to deal with them.
