![[1. Leon - Munchlax.png]]
## Description
Leon is Al's first Pokémon and someone that he holds dear for helping him rediscover his dream. The Big Eater Pokémon is a teal and cream creature with big, round eyes, large pointy ears, and two pointy teeth that stick out of his mouth even when closed. He has two five-fingered hands and two cream feet with three clawed toes that are hidden behind fur that drapes down to the ground. He is often seen with crumbs on his face and wears a thick orange cloth around his neck which he also doubles as a bib.

Leon is an all-around clueless Pokémon with only one thing on his mind. Food. He is an extremely active Pokémon when it comes to searching for food and does not mind running from place to place as he looks for it; although he is usually very slow-moving. The Big Eater Pokémon has grown fond of berries after meeting his trainer, Al, and longs for the day that they can return to the berry farm and he can eat loads of berries once more.

## Notes
- At times, Munchlax, if he's hungry, will eat anything even if it's not his or his trainers.
- Is easily bribed into doing things so long as he is given the proper payment in food.
