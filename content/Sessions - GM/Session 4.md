## Party Information and Recap
- N/A

## Descriptions and Details
- Route 2:
	- With a tragic end to the environmental fanatic, Benjamin, and a new friend in the security guard, Charles, you journey forward into Route 2, excited to see what your next leg of adventure has to offer. Unfortunately for Kurisu, its probably his biggest nightmare ever - the desert. Not a drop of water to be seen in this veritable ocean of sand. And if that weren't enough to dissuade the group, the sweltering heat of the sun at its peak with not even a cloud in sight seems to just about wheeze that this isn't worth it.

## NPCs Encounters
- Maraya
    - Gender: Female
    - Race: Unovan
    - Job: Pokémon Ranger (General)
    - Affection: Neutral
    - Voice and Inflection: soft with a western accent (cowboy), cares about the wellbeing of others and will try to dissuade people from doing stupid things.
    - NPC Dialogue Lines (what they know):
        - Dialogue 1: Introduces herself as Maraya and tells the party that she is a Pokémon Ranger and that she advises against traveling through Route 2 at the moment.
	        - Dialogue 1.5: If prompted for how long, she will tell the party indefinitely until this issue with a rampaging Hippowdon can be solved.
			- Dialogue 2: Maraya will tell the party about how the Hippowdon has caused two injuries already. A broken arm when it crashed into a trainer's Krokorok which in turn slammed into him, and a concussion from when it emerged from the ground and large chunk of ground hit another trainer in the head. No serious injuries yet, but its only a matter of time.
				- Dialogue 2.5: Maraya will tell the group that a man died on this Route to a Hippowdon two years ago and she believes that this Hippowdon is the same one.
        - Action 1: If the party insists on traveling through Route 2, she suggests that they battle and if they survive for three turns, she will let them go through because she will have assurance that they can handle themselves.

## Notes
- Charles gives Kurisu his security guard hat.
- Charles tells the party about his time dealing with the terrorist group, Team Dim Sum, in Fiore.
- Charles tells Al that the first kill is always the hardest and that he just needs to work through the feelings.
- Al has a sidebar with Kurisu and apologizes to Kurisu for punching him in the face in a fluster of emotions.
- Mimi returns Snorunt and Kurisu returns Pidgey for the desert environment.
- The party meet the Pokemon Ranger, Maraya, and she advises them to not cross Route 2 because of a rampaging Hippowdon. Kurisu remembers that Koa was killed by Hippowdon and is frightened by the prospect of meeting the Ground-Type. She also tells the group
- Kurisu challenges Maraya to a battle to prove that they're capable enough to avoid and fend off the Hippowdon if needed. They stay conscious against Maraya's Pignite for 15 seconds.
- Mimi recognizes that the deeper sand goes up to the waist (halves your speed) and tells the group about it.
- Kurisu, Mimi and Al notice two Diglett playing with some sand against the wall of a mountain. Mimi finds the perfect picture of the two Diglett's cuddling and posts it to Pokegram.
- Mimi discovers a Fuecoco, gnawing on a rock and heads over to it. It burps up a hot rock and tries to give it to Mimi. She picks it up and burns her hands for 1 Dmg.
- Kurisu sees a Hippopotas and chooses to go a different direction from the Hippopotas.
- Mimi manages to convince Fuecoco to come with her by saying, "You. Me. Journey. Rock!". She tries to convince Fuecoco to get in a Pokeball but the Fuecoco just grabs it from her hands and starts gnawing on the ball, but follows her willingly.
- Al sees and scans a Hippopotas playing with a bloody Pokeball. It notices Al, brings the Pokeball up to Hippopotas and drops it in front of Al. Al kneels down and looks Hippopotas - not a thought behind its eyes. Al taps the Pokeball to the Hippopotas' forehead and it returned to the ball - not a capture.
- Kurisu gets bit in the ass by a Trapinch. He doesn't know what it is.
- Mimi picks up Fuecoco and starts running. Her hair was singed by Fuecoco burping fire.
- Al notices a defensive Sandile where he passed the Hippopotas.
-  Kurisu chooses to run with whatever is biting his ass. Al wants to perceive Kurisu's ass.
