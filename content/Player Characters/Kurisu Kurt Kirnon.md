## Description
Kurisu Kurt Kirnon is a swimmer that both the ocean and Water-Type Pokemon alike love like their own child. He has a lean physique, befitting his swimming profession, and olive-brown skin 

Born in the small community of the aquatic Pacifidlog Town, Kurisu grew up in the water. He lived and breathed the ocean for the better part of eighteen years before setting out on his Pokemon adventure.
