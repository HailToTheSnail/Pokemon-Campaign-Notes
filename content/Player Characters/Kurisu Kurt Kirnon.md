## Description
Kurisu Kurt Kirnon is a swimmer that both the ocean and Water-Type Pokemon alike love like their own child. He has a lean physique, befitting his swimming profession, and olive-brown skin 

Kurisu Rupple is your basic protag swimmer boy. He has olive-brown skin, with  long, straight purple hair that reaches down to his upper back when it is in its customary low ponytail. He has a lean physique with absolutely chiseled calves. 

He wears a wetsuit with short sleeves and legs that cut off at the knee. He  has a pair of  red-rimmed swimming goggles he wears around his neck, as well as a black rubber wristband with the word HYDRODYNAMIK in bright gold letters.

He also has a pin that says FUCK RUSTBORO that he wears on his backpack.

He will eventually buy a burgundy dragon tamer’s cape with an adjustable collar, with golden trim.

Born in the small community of the aquatic Pacifidlog Town, Kurisu grew up in the water. He lived and breathed the ocean for the better part of eighteen years before setting out on his Pokemon adventure.

### [[Squirtle]]☆
The faithful Tiny Turtle Pokemon of Kurisu who has been by his side ever since the young swimmer found him out at sea. Having braved the oceans together, they have formed a camaraderie very few trainers can claim to have achieved.

## Backstory
Kurisu is a swimmer hailing from Pacifidlog town.

In many ways, Kurisu considered himself a child of the water. Living in an aquatic town with his coach father and his mother, a former Olympic swimmer, it was no wonder that Kurisu found himself an adept of the ocean from an early age. Since before he could remember, the Rupple family vacations traveling to the distant corners of Hoenn, never once booking passage of course. In the beginning, his parents would take turns carrying him on their backs, but he was soon able to carry himself through the water not long after leaving diapers. As he grew older however, Kurisu started to feel as though that something was missing. He’d enjoyed cross-country swimming plenty, but he felt confined in the tiny stretch of Hoenn in which his village resided.

Unlike his parents however, Kurisu was not entirely satisfied with the nomadic lifestyle they kept. Whenever they would stay in a pokemon Center for a night or two when they needed, he would always find himself glued to the little TVs, watching televised Pokemon tournaments with rapt attention. 

And so, as most eighteen year-olds do, he chose to follow this ambition without a second thought. Having heard about the Indalo region’s many notable bodies of water, Kurisu decided he would make his way over there. Signing up for the first possible method available, he made contact with a few would-be trainers over the internet, and trusted himself to figure out how he’d get a Pokemon on the way. Decision made, he began the several week long pilgrimage by water to Indalo. Just as any other impetuous eighteen year-old, Kurisu faced the consequences of his impetuosity when he realized that he did not in fact have the stamina to swim across several regions. 

Unfortunately, this realization came in the form of a leg cramp, in the middle of the ocean. As such, the young man found himself at the waves’ mercy. After washing up half-drowned on Cinnabar island in Kanto, he spent a few days recuperating his strength before setting out again, not having learned a single thing. As he passed through Seafoam island for a break, Kurisu discovered a wild Squirtle, ostensibly alone, with his tail trapped by fallen rocks from a partial cave-in. Kurisu, not being a heartless piece of shit, helped the Squirtle out, and shared some rations with the Pokemon before continuing his journey. The next time that the swimmer made landfall, he noticed that the Squirtle had followed him, apparently out of boredom. Not one to question anything, Kurisu went along with it and journeyed to Indalo with his new companion in tow, completely ignorant of what it meant to be a trainer, a good friend, or really even a human being.

In the Indalo region Kurisu faced both emotional and physical challenges he was utterly unprepared for. In the first two weeks of his journey, he’d been attacked and knocked unconscious more times than he could count, came extremely close to dying after having fallen into the den of an ancient predator in a fit of childish dejection, all while having been ignored, insulted, and threatened for the duration of his travel. In true fashion, very little of it had changed him, and he’d loved almost every single minute of it.

Every summer ends however, and Kurisu’s journey was no exception. Gibi, Kurisu’s self-styled older brother and mentor had had the misfortune of having a very smooth brain, leading him to try and inhale the fumes of a Gastly. After immediately being hospitalized, Gibi spent many weeks in a slow decline, as the Pokemon’s fumes collaborated with years of cigarettes and RedTauros to destroy his body from the inside. Kurisu spent this time at his bedside, prattling incessantly about his fake relationship problems with Toulouse Grenoble, a person who by all accounts did not give a shit about Kurisu. Forty-one days after entering the Anca town Pokemon Center, Gibi LaRue succumbed to his accumulated illnesses, and died. Whether it was his lungs finally giving out, or because Kurisu would occasionally unplug the life support machines to charge his phone, the world will never know.

What Koa knew however, was that his team’s dream of climbing to the top of the Indalo league was dead as their fourth member. Not only this, but he was now trapped together with Kurisu, for whom his hatred grew daily, and Kamille, a sheltered and indifferent boy with no significant understanding of the world. Thinking back on how his father, Professor Kukui, described his early Pokemon adventures, Koa began to wonder if his inability to enjoy himself might have been his fault. His thoughts gradually grew more and more dark, his growing apathy matched only by his immense hatred for Kurisu. Not long after, Kamille arranged for his family to airlift Gibi’s body back to Unova, and hosted an extremely vapid and self-congratulatory funeral for their former party member. Koa’s feelings came to a head when he realized that Kamille had brought Kurisu of all people to the funeral (because Kamille decided it would be more work to leave him surreptitiously in Indalo), while he had been left in Anca town. Not only this, but Kurisu had the gall to be streaming the funeral live on Twitch, to add insult to injury,

Koa couldn’t take it anymore. He left Pokemon Center, unable to cope with the memories, and went out for a night on the town. After getting more drunk than he’d ever been, Koa came to the conclusion that he needed to do something meaningful with his life before some horrible and random end came for him too. Feeling guilty in his inebriated state, Koa decided that he would return the Hippopotas he’d caught in the desert outside of Anca town, to begin his new life of good deeds. After making it up the cliffs with no small difficulty, the drunk man found himself in the same cave in which his party had traveled not less than a few weeks before. Releasing the Pokemon, Koa watched fondly as the family experienced a heartfelt reunion.  His blood ran cold however, when the Hippodown turned and leveled a red-eyed glare at him. Too drunk to keep his feet under him, Koa was not able to escape the enraged Pokemon as he had the last time. The details are irrelevant, suffice it to say his remains were found weeks later when the local gym leader, Cadmus, went hiking and that Professor Kukui opted to bury an empty casket.

Down two party members, and lifelong friends, Kurisu found himself devoid of human company and rudderless. He’d promised to stay in contact with Kamille, but his next message to the socialite got a “whodis? lol” in reply.

This was the last straw. Feeling completely alone in the world, (forgetting his parents and the loving community in which he was raised), Kurisu for the first time felt doubt about his dream to become King of the Water. During this crisis of faith, he gathered all of his Pokemon; Squirtle, Buizel, Trap, and Pinch. After a long, fraught conversation, Kurisu convinced his Pokemon that they were better off without him, because he didn’t have the strength to protect them yet. He made a tearful promise to his friends that one day he would become strong enough to keep them safe, and become King of the Water. They fell asleep that way, by the outskirts of Anca town, in a mournful pile of people and Pokemon. When he awoke the next day, only Squirtle remained. After managing to lose a brief argument against Squirtle, Kurisu somehow managed to understand that Squirtle would continue to be by his side.

With his resolve affirmed by his partner’s display of affection, the swimmer decided that his training would finally begin. After a week however, Kurisu remembered that he hated any form of training that wasn’t swimming. Instead, he camped in the wilderness outside of Alcon dam while earning a pittance from ad revenue on his occasional variety streams. He practiced his horn playing, literally swimming upstream, and started reading manhwa. Before he knew it, two years had passed. One day, Kurisu noticed that the Indalo league was beginning after seeing an ad online. Having forgotten the sting of grief (but wholly unimproved), Kurisu had a conversation with Squirtle, before concluding that they were ready to begin their journey again.

Though his grief disappeared, Kurisu still found himself afraid at the prospect of losing his new potential teammates. Not having the strength of will to become stronger, or smarter, or better in any meaningful way Kurisu instead opted to make himself more intimidating. To this end, he decided that he would become a dual specialist in water and dragon types, because any pokemon that can resist water types is obviously very scary. And so, he bought a fast drying cloak, and changed the colours on his swimsuit. Yet, it wasn’t enough. He knew that there was something missing. If reading massive amounts of manhwa during those two years had taught Kurisu anything, it was that people with a few white hairs were not to be messed with. Before he could go out to the store to buy the hair bleach, Squirtle had managed to steal a bottle for him. Kurisu smiled at this.

It seemed that the more things changed, the more they also stayed the same. Also, he would probably never die.

Having pissed away two years of his life, Kurisu felt substantially better about his grief, having forgotten aboutAfter seeing an ad for this year’s Indalo league, Kuri
