## Party Information and Recap
- Upon reaching Route 1, Mimi wants to take commemorative photos of the start of her journey. She gets Leon, Al's Munchlax, to take photos in front of a white flower for her PokéSnap account. 
- When Mimi sees Kurisu dive into the small pond at the beginning of the route, she tries to sneak a candid photo of him. However, he hears her snap the photo and demands that she deletes it. She eventually does after a bit of convincing.
- When the group stumbles upon a group of three kids, Kurisu recognizes the three of them as Adolescent Joey, Sammy, and Samantha and makes the first pee his pants when he makes the young kid remember how the swimmer bullied him two years ago. He then steals $150 Pokédollars and a Poké Ball from Adolescent Joey.
- Seeing this happen right before his eyes, Al tries to stop Kurisu from intimidating the young kids, but the kids call him a hired thug which gives Al a far-away look as he remembers his less than reputable shameful history.
- When neither Al or Mimi want to help Kurisu, the latter bribes Al's Munchlax, Leon, with 3 Camping Rations to join the battle. In addition, he offers Mimi with a limitless amount of candid shots with his consent to upload.
- During the battle, Squirtle rushes at the Nidoran - Male, tucks into his shell and slams into the Poison-Type
- After a brutal beatdown, Adolescent Joey, Samantha and Sammy are traumatized even further beyond what Kurisu had done prior to their battle. Kurisu gives Al 3 Camping Rations and the party earns 270 EXP (90 EXP each) from the battle.
- Traumatizing Samantha and Sammy by injuring their Pokemon, Squirtle broke off one of Nidoran's horns and embedded into its side. Leon slammed the Spearow into the ground bursting the berry he had on him, making it look like Spearow died. 
- After the battle, Kurisu gives Adolescent Joey a Poké Ball, inspiring/intimidating the poor boy into meeting Kurisu in the Zircon Conference at the end of the year.
- The group returns to the Pokémon Lab with Joey and co in tow to heal their Pokémon.
- Professor Stephen is disappointed in Al and Mimi for getting caught up in Kurisu's bullshit.
- The group set up camp on Route 1 and Al and Mimi start to talk about the problems that Kurisu brings to the group. Al has a one on one with Leon in order to make sure that they're on the same page and that they're in it together.
- Kurisu has a one on one with Al and apologizes for bribing Leon and getting his Pokemon injured, but was adamant that challenging the kids was alright. Each player used 1 Camping Rations for the night.
- The next day, they travel further up Route 1 and Mimi takes videos of Pidgey before noticing and taking a video of a Sandshrew pretending to be a Pidgey. Kurisu gets this vague notion of knowing the Pidgey and finally gets it when Squirtle goes up and hugs the Ground-Type that it's Gibi's Sandshrew.
- Kurisu gives Sandshrew 1 Camping Rations before they head into combat with the four wild Pidgey that Sandshrew was with. Sandshrew turns one of the Pidgey into paste. They earn 210 EXP (70 EXP each).
- Kurisu is streaming punting an unconscious Pidgey.
- Kurisu dives into the small pond to retrieve a Poké Ball.
- The group arrives at the end of Route 1.
