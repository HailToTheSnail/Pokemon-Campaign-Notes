## Backstory
Mimi Snowfall grew up in the serene countryside just outside Snowpoint City, where the chill of the northern winds was a constant companion. Her family’s cozy, snow-covered cottage stood at the edge of the vast, frosty wilderness, a perfect haven for both the living and the spectral. From a young age, Mimi was surrounded by the ethereal beauty of ghost-type Pokémon, who found their way to her home as naturally as the snowflakes drifting through the open windows. 

The snowy landscape was alive with whispers of the otherworldly, and Mimi felt an inexplicable connection to the ghost-type Pokémon that visited her. Her father, a devoted Pokémon researcher, often told tales of spirits and spectral beings, while her mother, a skilled Pokémon healer, nurtured the bonds between humans and Pokémon alike. The cottage was a place where warmth and comfort bridged the gap between the realms of the living and the departed. 

One particularly cold night, as the wind howled and the moonlight bathed the room in a ghostly glow, Mimi discovered an unusual visitor in her home. A Snorunt, shivering and seeking refuge from the bitter cold, had slipped through an open window. At first, Mimi was startled by the icy creature’s presence, but as she approached with a gentle smile, she saw the Snorunt’s timid eyes soften. She offered it a warm blanket and a bowl of stew, and from that moment, a bond was forged. 

Mimi and Snorunt became inseparable companions, sharing many adventures across the frosty landscape. Through their time together, Mimi and Snorunt met many ghost-type Pokémon and learned to understand their nuanced and often misunderstood nature. They were not malevolent spirits but rather beings of great depth and sensitivity, with their own stories and struggles. 

With the knowledge and affection she gained from her ghostly friends, Mimi set her sights on a grand quest: to embark on a Pokémon journey and raise awareness for ghost-type Pokémon. Armed with a Pokédex, a camera, she decided to leverage social media as her platform. She began documenting her travels and interactions with ghost-type Pokémon, sharing their stories and shedding light on their misunderstood nature.
