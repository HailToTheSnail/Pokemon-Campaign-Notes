## Descriptions and Details
 - Liyue River: (50% Zoom)
	- As you near the end of Route 1, you hear the crashing of choppy water and emerge from the tree line to see a large river that's at least twenty-five feet in width. While not exactly violent, it still seems extremely hard to cross by swimming alone. Maybe a strong swimmer could, but it'd still be dangerous. What really draws your attention though is the relatively new wooden bridge that travels the width of the river. It is held up by four large wooden stakes with two ropes attached from both stakes on one side of the river to the two stake on the other side of the river. There are also supporting ropes traveling from the the length of the main rope down to the wooden planks below. While it reminds you of every unsafe bridge that has been crossed high up in mountains in the movies, it looks far more structurally safe than those ones.
