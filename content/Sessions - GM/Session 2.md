## Descriptions and Details
- Route 1: (75% Zoom)
	- As you step foot outside of Solet Town, your hit with the sudden realization that you've started on your own adventure. Something you've dreamed of since childhood but never had the chance to actually experience. It was surreal in a sense, amplifying every aspect of what could be considered a rather generic Route. The vibrant forest path glows just a bit brighter in your eyes, the pleasing scent of berries and trees just that much more rich, and the chirping of wild Pidgey and the scuttling of wild Rattata rings louder in your ears. It's beautiful, ethereal despite its normality. You can see that the sun is starting to set in the distance, but you're fairly sure you can make it at least halfway to the end of the Route before you need to set up camp for the night.

## Notes
- Mimi gets Leon to take photos in front of a white flower for her PokéSnap.
- Mimi tries to get a candid photo of 
- Kurisu scared Joey and made him pee his pants then took \$150 from Adolescent Joey.
- Al tried to stop it but was called a hired thug of Kurisu's and was super effective psychological damage due to his backstory.
- Kurisu bribes Leon with 3 Camping Rations to join the battle and Mimi with unlimited video and photos with his consent to upload.
- The three protagonists beat Adolescent Joey, Samantha and Sammy and traumatized them even more than Kurisu already had. They earn 270 EXP (90 EXP each) and Kurisu gives Al 3 Camping Rations.
- Traumatized Samantha and Sammy by injuring their Pokemon, Squirtle broke off one of Nidoran's horns and embedded into its side. Leon slammed the Spearow into the ground bursting the berry he had on him, making it look like Spearow died. 
- After the battle, Kurisu gives Adolescent Joey a Poké Ball, inspiring/intimidating the poor boy into meeting Kurisu in the Zircon Conference at the end of the year.
- The group returns to the Pokémon Lab with Joey and co in tow to heal their Pokémon.
- Professor Stephen is disappointed in Al and Mimi for getting caught up in Kurisu's bullshit.
- The group set up camp on Route 1 and Al and Mimi start to talk about the problems that Kurisu brings to the group. Al has a one on one with Leon in order to make sure that they're on the same page and that they're in it together.
- Kurisu has a one on one with Al and apologizes for bribing Leon and getting his Pokemon injured, but was adamant that challenging the kids was alright. Each player used 1 Camping Rations for the night.
- The next day, they travel further up Route 1 and Mimi takes videos of Pidgey before noticing and taking a video of a Sandshrew pretending to be a Pidgey. Kurisu gets this vague notion of knowing the Pidgey and finally gets it when Squirtle goes up and hugs the Ground-Type that it's Gibi's Sandshrew.
- Kurisu gives Sandshrew 1 Camping Rations before they head into combat with the four wild Pidgey that Sandshrew was with. Sandshrew turns one of the Pidgey into paste. They earn 210 EXP (70 EXP each).
- Kurisu is streaming punting an unconscious Pidgey.
- Kurisu dives into the small pond to retrieve a Poké Ball.
- The group arrives at the end of Route 1.
