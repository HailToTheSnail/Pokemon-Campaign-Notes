The  small community is surrounded by large oak trees surrounding the entire town with small houses spaced sparsely throughout. The most prominent structure being the large glass and metal building near the western side of town, which is where Professor Stephen's Lab is located. However, there is also a relatively large restaurant called Café Solet which is posted near the south-eastern side of town which seems a pretty popular hang-out. Many of the lively citizens of Solet Town are out and going about their day in relative peace. They greet each other with warm smiles and friendly waves.
