## Description:
Kurisu Kurt Kirnon is a swimmer that both the ocean and Water-Type Pokemon alike love like their own child. Born in the small community of the aquatic Pacifidlog Town, Kurisu grew up in the water. He lived and breathed the ocean for the better part of eighteen years before setting out on his Pokemon adventure.

Kurisu Kurt Kirnon has a lean physique befitting his olive-brown skin

## Goals:
- To protect his friends to the end of the journey this time.

## Pokemon:

	- The faithful Tiny Turtle Pokemon of Kurisu who has been by his side ever since the young swimmer found him out at sea. Having braved the oceans together, they have formed a camaraderie very few trainers can claim to have achieved.
