## Party Information and Recap
- With two of our protagonists, Al and Mimi, just arriving in the Indalo region, they stop in Solet Town to meet with Professor Stephen and acquire a Pokédex. They stop by Café Solet for a rest before heading over to the laboratory. There they meet the final protagonist, Kurisu, stirring up a ruckus in the café.
- With all three sitting at the bar, Mimi asks for ice cubes for her Snorunt, while Al orders a veritable feast for himself and Munchlax; the order includes Vegetable Stuffed Lechonk Tenderloin (\$8) and Churros with Caramel Dip (\$8)
- Al introduces himself to Mimi before Kurisu barges his way into the conversation. Kurisu accidentally mistakes Mimi for a country hick and tries to tell her about the marvels of indoor lighting, which instigates a confrontation between the two. Kurisu orders a Thwack Energy Drink ($3) to take the edge off.
- When their server, Alexander, notices Mimi's Snorunt is missing, he heads to the kitchen to investigate which is when Kurisu tries to get his Squirtle to steal some booze from behind the bar. This fails spectacularly and the Tiny Turtle Pokémon breaks a few bottles before scrambling back over the bar to safety.
- Mimi exposes Kurisu when Alexander the server returns and snitches on Kurisu, who she does not have a good first impression of. She blames Kurisu for Squirtle's tendencies and tells the swimmer that she can give Squirtle a better life to his face. Kurisu gets upset about this and leaves the café, hoping Mimi gets cancer.
- Mimi orders a Chocolate-Vanilla Fruit Parfait ($10) to rid herself of that awful encounter.
- Kurisu manages to sneak back into his seat without Mimi noticing him but Al exposes the swimmer with a friendly greeting. Kurisu apologizes to Mimi for telling her to get cancer but remains firm about his friendship with Squirtle. They start to get along to a degree if the degree was in the negatives and buried near the core of the planet. Kurisu orders another Thwack Energy Drink ($3) to take the edge off.
- After some small talk, Kurisu asks Al if he wants to join him on his adventure across the Indalo region and Al agrees to go with him with no better plan in mind. However, Al also asks if Mimi wants to join them and she agrees as well.
- The party pay for their meals and leave Café Solet, Kurisu intentionally forgetting to pay, heading to Professor Stephen's Lab to receive their Pokédex and start their journey. 
- When they enter Professor Stephen's Lab, they see and meet Professor Stephen and Professor Sonia. They overhear Professor Sonia talking animatedly about geoglyphs and the possibility of an ancient lost Indalo civilization.
- Kurisu tries to flirt with the latter professor who he tried to flirt with two years ago when he first started his journey. It goes about as well as the last time and she escapes from the awkward encounter as quickly as possible.
- Professor Stephen provides the three protagonists with their Pokédex, introducing it as a mobile device, information hub and identification. He then offers the three of them a mock Pokémon battle to teach them the ropes, in spite of Kurisu having already battled before. The party earns 600 EXP (200 EXP each) from the battle.
- The three protagonists leave the lab to begin their own Pokémon adventure.
