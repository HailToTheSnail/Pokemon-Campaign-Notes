![[Providence.png]]
Providence is a cabal of corporate kingmakers run by three old family dynasties, known collectively as "the Partners". Pooling their vast wealth and resources over several decades, the Partners have patiently inserted loyal operatives into key positions of power inside the world's largest corporations, creating a shadow empire of unprecedented global reach and influence, while keeping its existence perfectly hidden.

For a long time, Providence had no plan or ambitions beyond protecting its interests and preserving the global status quo. The Partners had won already and to them, everything they did was simply to maintain the power they had accumulated over the years. 

However, in recent years, with the discovery of the Indalo Region, Providence has unearthed new information that mentions a weapon of mass destruction of the same caliber of the now defunct Ultimate Weapon of the Kalos region. With a new goal and a promise of total control of the Pokémon World, Providence has stirred once again.

## The Partners

### Arthur Fontaine
Arthur Fontaine (75), the current head of the Fontaine family, is the most senior Providence Partner and the power cabal's unofficial leader. Small and inconspicuous, Arthur's mild, soft-spoken demeanor hides a staggering and terrifying intellect. Devious, calculating and a master manipulator, he is an enigma, who has meticulously erased his own past in order to become invisible and untraceable.

As the current head of the Fontaine family, Arthur maintains the family's business empire in fields such as agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and consumer goods. However, the family's biggest source of income is their fossil energy business which has become one of the world's biggest providers of fossil energy.

- Blue Seedot Agriculture (influential pharmaceutical company)
- Thwack (beverage company) (Hitmonchan advertisement)

The Fontaines are responsible for most of the Providence operatives positioned in governments and state institutions around the world, including senators, cabinet secretaries, high-ranking rangers, and even a governor. They have also helped take complete control of the Azoth Kingdom in Kalos and the artificial island of Pasio.

### Gabrielle Mercer
Gabrielle Mercer (66) is the current head of the Mercer family and the second-most senior Providence Partner. Cold as ice and sharp as a razor, Gabrielle is regal, proud, and dignified and displays the kind of blunt rudeness that only people of nobility can get away with.

As the current head of the Mercer family, Gabrielle holds control over the Mercer Group, also referred to as Mercer Holdings or the Mercer Shipping Company. Her business empire was built upon businesses that dealt with shipping, railroads and newspaper publishing. As of recent years, the international conglomerate has been investing heavily in technological companies, playing a large but unseen role in the rise of social media.

- Quantum Leap (largest online retailer) (Porygon advertisement)
- Pelipper Global (global logistics/international shipping company)
- PokéTube (social media platform) (Pikachu and Eevee advertisement)

The Mercers largely control many of Providence's most crucial and lucrative assets, providing a sizeable chunk of the funding needed to continue Providence operations. In recent years, with the rumors of a weapon of mass destruction being hidden somewhere in Indalo, the Mercer Group is funding numerous Providence dig sites entirely on their own.

### Marcus Atwood
Marcus Atwood (51), the current head of the Atwood Family, is the youngest of the Providence Partners. He is brash, direct, and a cowboy at heart. With a strong proponent for order, diligence and excellence, Marcus tends to come across as officious and high-strung. 

As the current head of the Atwood family, Marcus has command of his family's assets, those of which include many banking and finance institutes, insurance, real estate, and legal services. Some of these services which the Atwood family use to hide Providence's assets and investments behind funds and shell companies.

- Gimmighoul Ltd. (insurance firm)
- Persian Finance (investment company)
- Judgement (law firm)

The Atwoods maintain good relations with the crime syndicates and operatives that work for Providence by using their intricate network of banks to indiscriminately launder money for the criminal organizations at relatively zero risk. The family is also responsible for eliminating any possible leaks or paper trails that may lead back to Providence.

## The Constant

### Giovanni Sakaki (Vanway Hister)
![[Vanway Hister (Giovanni Sakaki) (27px).png]]
Giovanni Sakaki (47), the former head of Team Rocket, is the current Constant of Providence. The top controller, chief strategist and second-in-command of the shadow cabal, answering only to the Partners themselves. Giovanni is a lion of a man with a quiet air of dominance and a steel handshake. He is also highly intelligent, perceptive and an astute judge of character.

After Team Rocket's plans to establish control of the Kanto and Johto regions were foiled by an eleven year old boy on numerous occasions, Giovanni Sakaki disbanded the criminal organization, resigned from his role as Viridian Gym Leader and left to better himself as a Pokémon Trainer so that he might return to resurrect Team Rocket.

While hiding out in the Tohjo Falls, Giovanni was approached by Providence who admired his capabilities to amass such notoriety in such a short span of time. The Partners offered him a position  in their organization, with the belief that he could accomplish similar achievements to what he did with Team Rocket. With the promise of a vast amount of power and influence, inhibited by political, ideological and national interests, Giovanni accepted the Partners' employment and became the first Constant of Providence.

At the request of the Partners, with his new position came a new identity, and Giovanni became Vanway Hister, an upstanding politician who while quiet and unnerving had the best interest of the people in mind. Ever since Giovanni was employed under the service of Providence, he has slowly and meticulously converted many influential corporations into Providence assets in order to help secure total control of all of the world's affairs.
 
Giovanni is also responsible for inducting many influential and powerful Providence Heralds and Operatives, such as Champion Cadence of the Indalo region, Kaelford Gym Leader Teft, Lex of the Hoenn Mafioso, and the Metro City Chief of Police Meltlake.

#### Pokémon
- Persian☆ (Male) (Normal-Type) - Persian is Giovanni's starter Pokémon that he rescued as a kid. The Classy Cat Pokemon has been by his trainer's side since the beginning of his journey and seen him through many tough battles. 
- Rhyperior (Male) (Ground/Rock-Type) (Mega Stone) - Rhyperior is Giovanni's ace and the Pokémon that the former Team Rocket head instinctively reached for when caught between a Golem and a hard place. Hardly ever knowing defeat, this invincible goliath of a Pokémon is a reliable pillar that Giovanni's team can rally behind.
- Honchkrow (Male) (Dark/Flying-Type) - Honchkrow is Giovanni's cloak and dagger Pokémon. He is an extremely fast and agile Pokémon that supports the team with accurate ranged attacks and precise drive-bys. The Big Boss Pokémon is also extremely fond of shiny objects.
- Nidoking (Male) (Poison/Ground-Type) - Nidoking is one of Giovanni's two most coordinated Pokémon alongside their mate, Nidoqueen. Together the two are a force capable of matching a minor Legendary Pokémon.
- Nidoqueen (Female) (Poison/Ground-Type) - Nidoqueen is one of Giovanni's two reliable two most coordinated Pokémon alongside their mate, Nidoking. Together the two are a force capable of matching a minor Legendary Pokémon.
- Kangaskhan (Female) (Normal-Type) - Kangaskhan is the Pokémon that Giovanni appears with in public under his identity as Vanway Hister. Despite appearing friendly in public, Kangaskhan is a very capable Pokémon that can tangle with the rest of the former Team Rocket head's team.

## The Heralds

### Meltlake
Meltlake (54) is the current Chief of Police of Metro City and a Herald of Providence. He is an extremely aggressive person towards criminals and suspects, and arrogant towards his peers, especially after his promotion to Chief of Police. He often dismisses the concerns of his subordinates and does not hesitate to assert his authority when needed. However, despite being unfeeling and apathetic to other people's suffering, he does have a soft side for his daughter or whenever her safety is concerned.

Following serious allegations against Meltlake's precinct during his captaincy, he was "asked" to take a leave of absence. During this time, Meltlake was approached by Vanway Hister and promised retribution in exchange for his services to Providence. He agreed and within the week, had the instigators of the smear campaign behind bars and was reinstated as captain. Within the decade, Meltlake made Chief of Police, establishing a firm hold in the justice system for Providence within Metro City.

### Teft
Teft (37) is the Gym Leader of Kaelford and a Herald of Providence. He is a polite and well-respected Gym Leader in public, but behind that façade is an arrogant, self-centered and greedy individual who is deeply invested in his own money and reputation. As a result, he views himself in a similar light to the lost royal lineage of Kaelford and believes the people within his city are his subjects and should always be in awe of him. After being invited to Providence, his ego has only inflated further, cementing his belief that he is above almost everyone including his fellow Heralds and Operatives.

During a gala event held by a major asset of Providence, Pelipper Global, Inc., Teft was approached by Vanway Hister and offered a position within the shadow cabal. The Gym Leader of Kaelford jumped at the opportunity, seeing Providence as acknowledgement that he had accrued enough wealth and reputation. With the position of Herald now secured, Teft lords over his post and delegates tasks to the Operatives within Kaelford and its surrounding settlements with delighted satisfaction.

#### Pokémon
- Swanna☆ (Female) (Water/Flying-Type) - Swanna is Teft's main Pokémon that he chose to appear more like a member of the lost royal lineage of Kaelford. The White Bird Pokémon is extremely pretentious, refusing to even put up a façade of benevolence like her trainer; only accepting the best food and treatment a Pokémon can get. Despite these negative traits, Swanna is an extremely capable and competitive Pokémon in battle and is willing to get her wings dirty to win at any cost.

## Operatives/Organizations

### Champion Cadence

Cadence (26) is the Champion of the Indalo region and an Operative of Providence. He is the kind, compassionate and loved sweetheart of the Indalo people and has kept his seat as Champion for over a decade. Cadence is the leading voice for just reformations in the Indalo government and has quickly garnered strong support from many influential political figures, such as Vanway Hister, in the past decade. 

This wasn't always the case though. When Cadence was crowned Champion, he made a promise to the people of Indalo to always fight for them. However, whenever the Champion tried to pass a bill, he was nearly always roadblocked by other politicians who found that the new laws would endanger their political agenda. Without any results to show, the people turned bitter with Cadence's promise and the public turned against him. It was at that point that Cadence despaired at humanity's greed and he was approached by Vanway Hister with a preposition that the Champion couldn't refuse.

After joining Providence as an Operative, Cadence had the full support of the shadow cabal and the many Operatives they had in the Indalo government. The politician in the pockets of Providence started to throw their support behind the young Champion, helping him pass bills, previously rejected, that would help the common folk. This helped reaffirm his affection with the people of Indalo and he quickly became the region's sweetheart once more. Providence had sunk its teeth into Indalo.

#### Pokémon
- Electivire☆ (Male) (Electric-Type) - Electivire is Champion Cadence's starter Pokémon and the first of its kind. Many people speculate that Electivire evolves from Electabuzz, but no one aside from Champion Cadence has achieved this feat. The Thunderbolt Pokémon is an extremely capable and competitive Pokémon that always pulls through for his trainer and always paves the path forward to victory.
- Chandelure (Genderless) (Ghost/Fire-Type) - Chandelure is 
- Flygon (Male) (Ground/Dragon-Type) - 
- Gyarados (Female) (Water/Flying-Type) (Alpha) - Gyarados is a behemoth of a Pokémon that comes from a time long, long ago.

### Ichiban Yamazaki/Kanto Yakuza
The Kanto Yakuza is a crime syndicate led by Ichiban Yamazaki with approximately 3,400 members. They are based in the Kanto region, and were one of the first criminal organizations to begin operating in other regions. Some time after the crime syndicate's inception, Ichiban Yamazaki became an operative of Providence with the Kanto Yakuza becoming an affiliated organization to the shadow cabal.

#### Team Rocket (former)
Team Rocket, the notorious criminal organization that shook the very foundations of Kanto and Johto. This gang was small-time and under the protection of the Kanto Yakuza until the notorious Giovanni took leadership and cut ties with the Kanto Yakuza, turning Team Rocket into the infamous criminal syndicate it had been.

### Hoenn Mafioso
The Hoenn Mafioso is a criminal organization with nearly 2,400 members that operate out of Hoenn under the leadership of Don Romano. However, in recent years, the Hoenn Mafioso have found themselves stagnating, stuck in their old ways that hinder their capabilities to compete with rival crime syndicates. Despite their decline in power, their leader Don Romano refuses to change the status quo, stubborn in his belief that the traditional way worked and that the organization didn't need to change.

After years of being overshadowed by the other crime syndicates, 

Lex is one of Giovanni's operatives that he inserts into the Hoenn Mafioso during their decline. Lex kills Don Romano to secure control of the Hoenn Mafioso and become an asset to Providence (secretly Giovanni who's plotting a revolt).

Alexander "Lex" Stone - is the second son of Joseph Stone, the president of Devon Corporation.
