## Notes
- Kurisu leads Al and Mimi to the Alcon Dam where they are turned down from entry because its been closed off to the public since the Avatar Bridge had been rebuilt a year ago. Kurisu talks with one of the security guards, Charles, who he'd done a stream with before and has KBBQ and hotpot with. Kurisu gives Charles $5 for the information about the bridge and being himself.
- The party see Benjamin from afar at the Avatar Bridge, who tells them that they can cross for $200, but upon seeing Kurisu, he ups the toll to $999. When the party is shocked by the price and tries to cross the bridge without paying, Benjamin shows a document of ownership of the Avatar Bridge. 
- Mimi starts to film the whole ordeal but Benjamin is extremely persuasive and turns Chat against Kurisu, save for the Gen 9 babies. He vilifies himself by being blunt and abrasive and getting all up in Benjamin's face.
- Upon closer inspection of Benjamin, Al and Kurisu see that he is extremely confident in his document and head back to Charles to try and head across there again since Benjamin is being unreasonable with the toll pricing of the bridge.
- When they return to the Alcon Dam, Charles tells them that the bridge is public property and that this Benjamin could not have ownership over it. He goes with the party to the Avatar Bridge and exposes Benjamin for lying about ownership of the bridge.
- Mimi starts filming the entire thing, but Benjamin
- Ben befriends Al before throwing himself off the bridge. "Maybe in another world, we could've been friends. Thank you, Al. I am one with nature."
