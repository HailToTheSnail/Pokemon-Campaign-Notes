## History:
- **Kaiju Trio:**
	- While the legends in Sinnoh depict Arceus creating Azelf (willpower), Uxie (knowledge), and Mesprit (emotion) after the Creation Trio, the truth is that the Origin Pokémon created another trio of Legendaries before the Lake Guardians. A prototype to Emotion, Knowledge, and Willpower. Concepts less refined jammed into vessels incapable of holding such vast abstractions. Courage, Power, and Wisdom. Diphisra, Infernagon, and Gamera.
	- Incapable of returning the concepts of Courage, Power, and Wisdom to the Void, Arceus instead sealed the Kaiju Trio away within the earth, sky and water of present-day Indalo. Having learnt better, the Origin Pokemon then took a small fraction of the Kaiju Trio's power and created Azelf (willpower), Uxie (knowledge), and Mesprit (emotion)
- **The Kingdom of Elkia:** 
	- The Indalo region used to be recognized as the Kingdom of Elkia by Immanity before most of their history was lost to the ravages of time save for a few murals left in locations of importance to the Kaiju Trio.
