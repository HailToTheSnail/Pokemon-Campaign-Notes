## Descriptions and Details
- Anca Town:
	- Pushing yourselves off the ground and onto your knees, you ignore the rough sand that has crept into your clothes and look up slowly, still disoriented from your nasty fall off the cliff side of Route 2. In front of you is a sprawling low-rise desert town that is both colourful and alive. The powerful scent of spices linger on your nose and the bustle of activity on the streets catches your eye. Small vibrant stalls line either side of the sandstone streets with people hocking their wares—anything from  uncommon Berries to luxurious silks.
	 You recognize that many of the buildings in the desert town are single-story and built of sandstone and mud with either flat or gently sloping roofs. Some of these homes have rooftop gardens brimming with a panoply of Berries, while a number of these homes are highlighted with unique patterns such as dots, flowers, lines, squiggles, and zig-zags of varying vibrant colours. 
	 A few of the buildings in particular are noticeably different in this low-rise town, those of which include—the bright orange roof of a Pokemon Center, the deep blue of a Poke Mart, the large two-story sandstone building with gargoyles out front, and the most eye-catching structure being a massive statue of a lindwyrm Pokemon that towers over the rest of the buildings in the small town.
- Anca Ruins:
	- Stepping over and past the caution tape, you make your way inside the entrance of the cavern and into where the Anca Ruins undoubtedly are. You walk into a dimly lit cavern that opens up near the far end. At the back of the cavern is the remains of what looks to be the entrance to some caved-in ruins. There are intricate details that two of you cannot make out—Al recognizes it as Ancient Language.
	 In front of the ruins, you see
- Infernagon Statue:
	- Walking up the statue, you stand in awe of the  are aware of the fact that the Pokémon that it depicts takes on the shape of a lindwyrm
- Inferno Mines:
	- Walking into the caverns of the Inferno Mines, you’re immediately made aware of the sharp plicking of metal on stone echoing off the claustrophobic tunnel you traverse. The low light of the lanterns strung along the wooden scaffolding scarcely lights up the ground in front of you as you follow the length of steel tracks that lead into a much larger cave. Your eyes continue to follow the tracks that led you here that cross the cavern and down a new mineshaft. When you take in the rest of the underground chamber, you notice a pond of still water where you’re certain you see gentle ripples. You also notice another set of tracks on an upper ledge of the cavern that leads down another mineshaft. 
	 Near the back of the cavern, you see a scruffy older man in a bright blue outfit and yellow hard hat holding a clipboard. You hear him shout something out to another worker in similar apparel who shout back an affirmative before he start swinging his pickaxe against the rough stone walls.
- Museum Gym:
	- Stepping into the museum, your eyes notice the small booth to your left where a desk clerk is sitting and tapping away at a computer. He seems to ignore your entrance and you look beyond into the museum itself. The interior is massive and numerous tourists, and you can tell they're tourists with their expensive cameras and pale skin, moseying about from attraction to attraction. They cluster around fossils and skeletons organized neatly around the perimeter of the building interior. Benches and plants are scattered around the museum to provide places of rest for the guests and bring some much needed greenery into the otherwise colourless building. You notice that the groups of people leave a noticeable open area at the center of the museum that you aren't aware of the reason for—bar perhaps Kurisu.
- Pokémon Center:
	- Stepping into the Pokemon Center, you're greeted by the immediately greeted by the quiet chatter of numerous trainers returning from their own training or battles for the day. Many were handing their Pokeballs to the nurse manning the front desk, while others were
- Poké Mart:

- Al gets the Hippopotas' Poke Ball checked by Nurse Joy. She shows the party, sans Kurisu, the picture of the previous owner, Koa Kukui, and Squirtle stands up on the desk and places his hand against the screen in sadness.
- Mimi and Al try to comfort Squirtle but ultimately let him be, where he wanders over to a gentleman who the Water-Type asks for a cigarette but the man tells him not to drink. They have an awkward moment afterwards.
- Mimi and Al go explore town while waiting for Kurisu and Fuecoco and come upon a stone statue of a winged dragon Pokemon. Mimi tries and fails to recognize the language, while Al, who'd worked in the Underworld and seen numerous priceless artifacts being peddled, recognizes the language from an underground auction. 
- He remembers the auctioneer mention the Ancient Language which was heavily implied to be connected to the mysterious Pokemon, the Unown.
- A nearby man tells them about the winged dragon Pokemon and how it was Infernagon, a Legendary Pokemon that helped form the lands with its fire. It is the protector of the Inferno Desert, where Anca Town is located within. However, he mentions that Infernagon has only been mentioned to be seen once before the Lost Age, where presumably any other mention of the Pokemon was destroyed.
- Mimi and Al return to the Pokemon Center and Nurse Joy returns the Fuecoco, telling Mimi that the Pokemon has a problem with gnawing on anything it can get their stubby arms on. 
- She gets a phone call from the nurses in the back and ask the party for help subduing Kurisu who won't give up the Trapinch.
- When the party find Kurisu with the Trapinch in his arms, trapped in a dead end blocked off by Chansey, he looks desperate and feral, refusing to let anyone take the Trapinch from him. He keeps referring to the Pokemon as Trap and how everything was going to be okay.
- Squirtle goes over and gives Kurisu a hug, knowing the pain that Kurisu is going through due to this being where his last journey ended and two of his companions died.
- Trapinch is confused by the the trainer and his Pokemon crying over him and Kurisu sees all of his friends in the sunset light disappearing without him. He mentions how he might need a therapist but Trapinch is moved by his and Squirtle's emotional moment and asks to be taken with them on their adventure.
- Al gives Kurisu a Poke Ball and Kurisu catches the Trapinch.
- When they go to their room, Kurisu is on to Al and Mimi about the Hippopotas, while Al tries desperately to scrub off the dried blood. Mimi watches some news to learn about Gym Leader, Melina, raiding a Hoenn Mafioso hideout in Taioh City.
- Kurisu starts to question why the Hippowdon was chasing them and stated questioning what the reason could be.
- Mimi rushes into the bathroom after giving Kurisu an excuse and both Mimi and Al decide to tell Kurisu about the Hippopotas. They give him final say over the Ground-Type.
- Kurisu gets really emotional but refuses to make a decision because he thinks he might kill the Hippopotas. The Future King of Water asks Al to let the Hippopotas out.
- The Hippopotas recognizes Kurisu and nuzzles against him, convincing the Future King of Water that the Ground-Type can stay if Al wants to keep them.

- Mimi finds a pile of dirt and runs through it. She trips over something metal that also stabs into her leg, hurting her.
- Kurisu calls for a medic and a miner by the name Kevin comes over and tries to help her. She gets up before Kevin can help and he gets mad at Kurisu for asking for help when it wasn't needed and walks off.
- Mimi sifts through the dirt and sees an iron dome with green spikes on it. Kurisu perceives it further and sees a pair of yellow eyes glaring at the group, but doesn't care to look at it any more and walks away.
- Al uncovers the rest of the green and steel spiked dome before staring and scanning the small Steel-Type to learn it's a Ferroseed; he then used a Nest Ball to capture it.
- Party scanned the Ferroseed.
- Kurisu meets a trainer named Joey who was trying his hands at mining. He hadn't found anything of note save for colourful rocks. Mimi asks for some of the rocks for Fuecoco and he gives her five different coloured rocks.

- Mimi sees an eye peering up at her from the ground beside the minecart and gets Al to try and see it; he doesn't see shit. Mimi pokes the ground and an eye peeks out again. Al scans the Pokemon and learns that its an Aron.
- They ignore the Aron and take the minecart to where Kurisu is at a ledge midway across the chasm. They find another pile of rocks and Kurisu has a quick conversation with Miner Derek while Mimi sifts through the rocks. She finds nothing.
- Kurisu inspects the minecart because of past trauma with the Zubats from two years ago. He doesn't see anything wrong with it and neither does Mimi.
- They get in and try to travel across the rest of the chasm but slow down midway across the chasm. Mimi gets out of the minecart and tries to run the rest of the way but is ambushed by a horde of Zubats and forced into a battle.

- They try to get Gym Leader Cadmus' attention, but he has headphones on and is singing "Call Me Maybe." They tap his shoulder and do everything to get his attention, but nothing works until Kurisu waves his arm in front of Cadmus, risking his arm from the pickaxe swings that Cadmus is swinging.
- He tells them that he can set up three challenges for tomorrow morning at nine before asking if they'd like to try mining with him. The party tries but fails epically, including their Pokemon. They wait for Cadmus to create a new tunnel because they did not want to return the way they went.
- The party leaves the cavern and parts ways with Gym Leader Cadmus.
