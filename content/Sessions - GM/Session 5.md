## Notes
- The party is chased out of Route 2 by the Hippowdon and off a cliffside into Anca Town.
- When the party wake at the bottom of the cliffside, Al slaps Kurisu awake and notices the Trapinch attached to his friend's ass. He doesn't comment or tell Kurisu about it.
- Mimi and Al drag Kurisu to the Pokemon Center to get checked up. 
- Arrive at the Pokemon Center and Al tells Nurse Joy about Kurisu's injury.
- Kurisu is brought to the ICU while Mimi gives Nurse Joy the Fuecoco for a check-up.
- Al gets the Hippopotas' Poke Ball checked by Nurse Joy. She shows the party, sans Kurisu, the picture of the previous owner, Koa Kukui, and Squirtle stands up on the desk and places his hand against the screen in sadness.
- Mimi and Al try to comfort Squirtle but ultimately let him be, where he wanders over to a gentleman who the Water-Type asks for a cigarette but the man tells him not to drink. They have an awkward moment afterwards.
- Mimi and Al go explore town while waiting for Kurisu and Fuecoco and come upon a stone statue of a winged dragon Pokemon. Mimi tries and fails to recognize the language, while Al, who'd worked in the Underworld and seen numerous priceless artifacts being peddled, recognizes the language from an underground auction. 
- He remembers the auctioneer mention the Ancient Language which was heavily implied to be connected to the mysterious Pokemon, the Unown.
- A nearby man tells them about the winged dragon Pokemon and how it was Infernagon, a Legendary Pokemon that helped form the lands with its fire. It is the protector of the Inferno Desert, where Anca Town is located within. However, he mentions that Infernagon has only been mentioned to be seen once before the Lost Age, where presumably any other mention of the Pokemon was destroyed.
- Mimi and Al return to the Pokemon Center and Nurse Joy returns the Fuecoco, telling Mimi that the Pokemon has a problem with gnawing on anything it can get their stubby arms on. 
- She gets a phone call from the nurses in the back and ask the party for help subduing Kurisu who won't give up the Trapinch.
- When the party find Kurisu with the Trapinch in his arms, trapped in a dead end blocked off by Chansey, he looks desperate and feral, refusing to let anyone take the Trapinch from him. He keeps referring to the Pokemon as Trap and how everything was going to be okay.
- Squirtle goes over and gives Kurisu a hug, knowing the pain that Kurisu is going through due to this being where his last journey ended and two of his companions died.
- Trapinch is confused by the the trainer and his Pokemon crying over him and Kurisu sees all of his friends in the sunset light disappearing without him. He mentions how he might need a therapist but Trapinch is moved by his and Squirtle's emotional moment and asks to be taken with them on their adventure.
- Al gives Kurisu a Poke Ball and Kurisu catches the Trapinch.
- When they go to their room, Kurisu is on to Al and Mimi about the Hippopotas, while Al tries desperately to scrub off the dried blood. Mimi watches some news to learn about Gym Leader, Melina, raiding a Hoenn Mafioso hideout in Taioh City.
- Kurisu starts to question why the Hippowdon was chasing them and stated questioning what the reason could be.
- Mimi rushes into the bathroom after giving Kurisu an excuse and both Mimi and Al decide to tell Kurisu about the Hippopotas. They give him final say over the Ground-Type.
- Kurisu gets really emotional but refuses to make a decision because he thinks he might kill the Hippopotas. The Future King of Water asks Al to let the Hippopotas out.
- The Hippopotas recognizes Kurisu and nuzzles against him, convincing the Future King of Water that the Ground-Type can stay if Al wants to keep them.
- After that emotionally-draining event, Mimi buys the party some good takeout and they have a nice, relaxing night.
- When they wake up, the party head to the Gym, which turns out to be the Museum.
- The party learn that Gym Leader Cadmus was at the Inferno Mines and that he often didn't return for days. The party choose to go get him.
- The party head to the Inferno Mines and get ready to head in.
