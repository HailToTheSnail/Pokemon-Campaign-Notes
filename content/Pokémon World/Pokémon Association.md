The Pokémon Association is a diplomatic and political international organization whose stated purposes are to maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations among regions, achieve international cooperation, and serve as a center for harmonizing the actions of regions. At it's founding, the Pokémon Association was comprised of only eight regions; as of this year, it has eighteen – almost all of the world's sovereign regions. It is currently the world's largest international organization.

## History
The Pokémon Association was established after the second Great Pokémon War between Kanto and Johto with the aim of preventing future wars and the utilization of Pokémon in said wars. After a peace treaty was signed between Kanto and Johto, the two regions pooled their resources together and held a conference inviting the six other major regions: Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, Galar, and Paldea. Together, these eight regions established the United Core Regions (UCR), and the organization's foundational treaty, the Charter of the United Core Regions. 

After a decade, the UCR's member regions increased from eight to twelve with the additions of Almia, Fiore, Lental, and the Sevii Islands. With the increased member count, the UCR saw a radical expansion in its peacekeeping duties, taking on more missions in a year than in the past decade since its inception. 

Within another decade, the UCR welcomed Ferrum, Oblivia, and Orre into its folds. With over eighty percent of positions of power being filled by the eight founding regions, critics of the UCR condemned the organization for perceived mismanagement and corruption. Within a couple of years, the UCR had made many internal changes to staff in order to appease the growing concerns of the masses.

With so many new smaller regions joining the UCR, many of the representatives of these smaller  regions made their disapproval of the organization's name known, and after a vote and much deliberation, the UCR was succeeded by the Pokémon Association. A name chosen to honor the lessons learned with using Pokémon as tools of war.

In the last twenty years, the Pokémon Association has acknowledged Alola as a proper sovereign region and membership was admitted for the tropical region. In addition, the first man-made artificial island, Pasio, which already had the sponsorship and approval of the Pokémon Association, was completed and accepted into the international organization. Finally, membership was also extended to Indalo with its recent discovery, which the region representative was happy to accept and join the Pokémon Association.
