## Organizations
- The Kingsman Secret Service is a secret organization that works directly for the Crown. They function as secret agents that do everything in their power to keep Indalo safe. They are highly-trained agents with a partner Pokèmon and each have code names based on the Knights of the Round Table.
	- All Kingsman agents are supported by two individuals known by the code-names "Merlin" and "Morgana" in reference to Merlin the Wizard and Morgana le Fay, who oversees the agency support staff, formulates field strategies, trains prospective recruits and provides technological/IT assistance as necessary.
	- Each Kingsman has a signet ring that identifies them as a Kingsman.

He tolerates many of the insults thrown his way but will vehemently defend Sir Geheris if his character is slandered.

A slave to Cipher, Lugia unwillingly did their bidding, robbed of their freedom and putting up a futile resistance. Eventually, Lara was freed from Cipher by Michael.

They are the discarded Vessels, beings of the Void, created by the Pale King as a means of stopping the Infection, an ancient sickness that led to the deaths of thousands of bugs and ultimately the ruination of the kingdom of Hallownest. Unworthy and incapable of achieving the goals set by the Pale King, these unwanted Vessels are left to wander the depths of the Abyss for eternity.

## History
- **Chrovos:**
    - In Sinnoh mythology, the Sinnoh people depict Arceus as the first being and creator of the universe. That isn't entirely true as 
- **Kaiju Trio:**
    - While the legends in Sinnoh depict Arceus creating Azelf (willpower), Uxie (knowledge), and Mesprit (emotion) after the Creation Trio, the truth is that the Origin Pokémon created another trio of Legendaries before the Lake Guardians. A prototype to Emotion, Knowledge, and Willpower. Concepts less refined jammed into vessels incapable of holding such vast abstractions. Courage, Power, and Wisdom. Diphisra, Infernagon, and Gamera.
    - Afraid of the consequences 
    - Incapable of returning the concepts of Courage, Power, and Wisdom to the Void, Arceus instead sealed the Kaiju Trio away within the earth, sky and water of present-day Indalo. Having learnt better, the Origin Pokemon then took a small fraction of the Kaiju Trio's power and created Azelf (willpower), Uxie (knowledge), and Mesprit (emotion) and
- **Earthbound Immortals (based on Nazca Lines):**
    - The Earthbound Immortals are six extremely powerful and dangerous Legendary Pokémon without sentience whose sole purpose is to maintain the seals that keep Chrovos from setting the Pokémon World aflame in chaos. They are sealed in geoglyphs across the Indalo region, some of which have been uncovered while others have been lost to time itself.
    - One of the Kaiju Trio awaken whenever one of the Earthbound Immortals are set free and act as wardens of sorts to the otherwise walking disasters that are the Earthbound Immortals.
    - They are based on the [Nazca Lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca_lines) in the Nazca Desert in southern Peru.
- **The Kingdom of Edria:**
    - The Indalo region used to be recognized as the Kingdom of Edria by the Edrians, the people of Elkia, before most of their history was lost to the ravages of time save for a few murals left in locations of importance to the Kaiju Trio.
