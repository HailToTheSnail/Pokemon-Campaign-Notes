Route 2 - Female Pokemon Ranger tries to dissuade party from crossing due to an aggressive Hippowdon that'd awakened and started causing trouble. It had killed someone two years ago, Koa, and sorta just disappeared, hibernated, until now. It has already attacked two travelers, being the cause of a broken arm and a concussion, and the ranger fears that the injuries will only get worse.
