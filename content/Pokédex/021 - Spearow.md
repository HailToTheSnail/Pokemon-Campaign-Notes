## Description
Spearow can fly very high and fast, but expend a lot of energy flapping their tiny wings to do so. Because of this, they can only fly for short distances. They flush out bugs by flapping their wings in tall grass to create gusts, like their relatives Pidgey. 
Spearow are highly aggressive and territorial, closely observing their land and letting out high-pitched shrieks that can be heard from over a half-mile (a kilometer) away to alert fellow Spearow of potential dangers. Though territorial against other Pokémon, Spearow are not solitary and will coexist with others of their kind. Their calls signal nearby Spearow to flock together and attack. Because they almost always attack in large flocks, Spearow can be very formidable foes despite their small size and individual weakness. However, lone Spearow can be reckless when facing large foes. Flocks can be dangerous to unwary travelers, so trainers must always be cautious of Spearow cries while traveling through their territory. Farmers appreciate them, though, for clearing fields of pests.
