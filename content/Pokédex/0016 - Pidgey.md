## Description
Pidgey are very docile Pokémon that prefer to avoid confrontation with other Pokémon and humans altogether, hiding in tall grass to prevent themselves from being seen. If cornered, though, they will attempt to escape by using Sand Attack to blind foes or Whirlwind to blow them away and buy themselves time to fly away. However, when hunting, Pidgey often use these attacks to stir up their surroundings, exposing vulnerable insects for them to chase down. 
These Pokémon have extremely keen senses of direction. They can always find their way back to their nests regardless of how far they have flown. Because of this, Pidgey were commonly used to send messages in the Kanto and Johto regions (much like the Wingull of Hoenn), at least until the advent of e-mail. 
Many Pidgey have grown accustomed to and now dwell in urban areas due to this practice, flying to forests and fields only to hunt for food before returning back to their nests in cities. Some people still train Pidgey to deliver messages as a way of preserving tradition.
