Providence is a cabal of corporate kingmakers run by three old family dynasties, known collectively as "the Partners". Pooling their vast wealth and resources over several decades, the Partners have patiently inserted loyal operatives into key positions of power inside the world's largest corporations, creating a shadow empire of unprecedented global reach and influence, while keeping its existence perfectly hidden.

For a long time, Providence had no plan or ambitions beyond protecting its interests and preserving the global status quo. The Partners had won already and to them, everything they did was simply to maintain the power they had accumulated over the years. 

However, in recent years, with the discovery of the Indalo Region, Providence has unearthed new information that mentions a weapon of mass destruction of the same caliber of the now defunct Ultimate Weapon of the Kalos region. With a new goal and a promise of total control of the Pokémon World, Providence has stirred once again.

## The Partners: 

### Arthur Fontaine -
Arthur Fontaine (75), the current head of the Fontaine family, is the most senior Providence Partner and the power cabal's unofficial leader. Small and inconspicuous, Arthur's mild, soft-spoken demeanor hides a staggering and terrifying intellect. Devious, calculating and a master manipulator, he is an enigma, who has meticulously erased his own past in order to become invisible and untraceable.

As the current head of the Fontaine family, Arthur maintains the family's business empire in fields such as agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and consumer goods. However, the family's biggest source of income is their fossil energy business which has become one of the world's biggest providers of fossil energy.

- Blue Seedot Agriculture (influential pharmaceutical company)
- Thwack (beverage company) (Hitmonchan advertisement)

The Fontaines are responsible for most of the Providence operatives positioned in governments and state institutions around the world, including senators, cabinet secretaries, high-ranking rangers, and even a governor. They have also helped take complete control of the Azoth Kingdom in Kalos and the artificial island of Pasio.

### Gabrielle Mercer -
Gabrielle Mercer (66) is the current head of the Mercer family and the second-most senior Providence Partner. Cold as ice and sharp as a razor, Gabrielle is regal, proud, and dignified and displays the kind of blunt rudeness that only people of nobility can get away with.

As the current head of the Mercer family, Gabrielle holds control over the Mercer Group, also referred to as Mercer Holdings or the Mercer Shipping Company. Her business empire was built upon businesses that dealt with shipping, railroads and newspaper publishing. As of recent years, the international conglomerate has been investing heavily in technological companies, playing a large but unseen role in the rise of social media.

- Quantum Leap (largest online retailer) (Porygon advertisement)
- Pelipper Global (global logistics/international shipping company)
- PokéTube (social media platform) (Pikachu and Eevee advertisement)

The Mercers largely control many of Providence's most crucial and lucrative assets, providing a sizeable chunk of the funding needed to continue Providence operations. In recent years, with the rumors of a weapon of mass destruction being hidden somewhere in Indalo, the Mercer Group is funding numerous Providence dig sites entirely on their own.

### Marcus Atwood -
Marcus Atwood (51), the current head of the Atwood Family, is the youngest of the Providence Partners. He is brash, direct, and a cowboy at heart. With a strong proponent for order, diligence and excellence, Marcus tends to come across as officious and high-strung. 

As the current head of the Atwood family, Marcus has command of his family's assets, those of which include many banking and finance institutes, insurance, real estate, and legal services. Some of these services which the Atwood family use to hide Providence's assets and investments behind funds and shell companies.

- Gimmighoul Ltd. (insurance firm)
- Persian Finance (investment company)
- Judgement (law firm)

The Atwoods maintain good relations with the crime syndicates and operatives that work for Providence by using their intricate network of banks to indiscriminately launder money for the criminal organizations at relatively zero risk. The family is also responsible for eliminating any possible leaks or paper trails that may lead back to Providence.

## The Constant:

### Giovanni Sakaki (Vanway Hister) -
![[Vanway Hister (Giovanni Sakaki) (27px).png]]
Giovanni Sakaki (47), the former head of Team Rocket, is the current Constant of Providence. The top controller, chief strategist and second-in-command of the shadow cabal, answering only to the Partners themselves. Giovanni is a lion of a man with a quiet air of dominance and a steel handshake. He is also highly intelligent, perceptive and an astute judge of character.

After Team Rocket's plans to establish control of the Kanto and Johto regions were foiled by an eleven year old boy on numerous occasions, Giovanni Sakaki disbanded the criminal organization, resigned from his role as Viridian Gym Leader and left to better himself as a Pokémon Trainer so that he might return to resurrect Team Rocket.

While hiding out in the Tohjo Falls, Giovanni was approached by Providence who admired his capabilities to amass such notoriety in such a short span of time. The Partners offered him a position  in their organization, with the belief that he could accomplish similar achievements to what he did with Team Rocket. With the promise of a vast amount of power and influence, inhibited by political, ideological and national interests, Giovanni accepted the Partners' employment and became the first Constant of Providence.

At the request of the Partners, with his new position came a new identity, and Giovanni became Vanway Hister, an upstanding politician who while quiet and unnerving had the best interest of the people in mind. Ever since Giovanni was employed under the service of Providence, he has slowly and meticulously converted many influential corporations into Providence assets in order to help secure total control of all of the world's affairs.
 
Giovanni is also responsible for inducting many influential and powerful Providence Heralds and Operatives, such as Champion Cadence of the Indalo region, Kaelford Gym Leader Teft, Lex of the Hoenn Mafioso, and the Metro City Chief of Police Meltlake.

- Rhyperior (Male) (Ground/Rock-Type) - Rhyperior is Giovanni's ace and the Pokémon that the former Team Rocket head instinctively reaches for when caught between a Golem and a hard place. Hardly ever knowing defeat, this invincible goliath of a Pokémon is a reliable pillar that Giovanni's team can rally behind.
- Nidoking (Male) (Poison/Ground-Type) - Nidoking is one of Giovanni's two most coordinated Pokémon alongside their mate, Nidoqueen. Together the two are a force capable of matching a minor Legendary Pokémon.
- Nidoqueen (Female) (Poison/Ground-Type) - Nidoqueen is one of Giovanni's two reliable two most coordinated Pokémon alongside their mate, Nidoking. Together the two are a force capable of matching a minor Legendary Pokémon.

- Kangaskhan (Female) (Normal-Type) - Kangaskhan is the Pokémon that Giovanni appears with in public under his identity as Vanway Hister. Despite appearing friendly in public, Kangaskhan is a very capable Pokémon that can tangle with the rest of the former Team Rocket head's team.

### Ichiban Yamazaki/Kanto Yakuza -
The Kanto Yakuza is a crime syndicate led by Ichiban Yamazaki with approximately 3,400 members. They are based in the Kanto region, and were one of the first criminal organizations to begin operating in other regions. Some time after the crime syndicate's inception, Ichiban Yamazaki became an operative of Providence with the Kanto Yakuza becoming an affiliated organization to the shadow cabal.

#### Team Rocket (former) -
Team Rocket, the notorious criminal organization that shook the very foundations of Kanto and Johto. This gang was small-time and under the protection of the Kanto Yakuza until the notorious Giovanni took leadership and cut ties with the Kanto Yakuza, turning Team Rocket into the infamous criminal syndicate it had been.

### Hoenn Mafioso -
The Hoenn Mafioso is a criminal organization with nearly 2,400 members that operate out of Hoenn under the leadership of Don Romano. However, in recent years, the Hoenn Mafioso have found themselves stagnating, stuck in their old ways that hinder their capabilities to compete with rival crime syndicates. Despite their decline in power, their leader Don Romano refuses to change the status quo, stubborn in his belief that the traditional way worked and that the organization didn't need to change.

After years of being overshadowed by the other crime syndicates, 

Lex is one of Giovanni's operatives that he inserts into the Hoenn Mafioso during their decline. Lex kills Don Romano to secure control of the Hoenn Mafioso and become an asset to Providence (secretly Giovanni who's plotting a revolt).
