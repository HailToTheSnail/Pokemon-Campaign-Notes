The Pokémon World is home to both humans and Pokémon alike. It is a rocky, terrestrial planet with a solid and active surface with mountains, valleys, canyons, plains and so much more. The Pokémon World is especially special because it is an ocean planet with over 70% of its surface being covered in water. This makes it the only planet known in the Pokémon universe capable of sustaining life, making it a convenient place for life to have begun billions of years ago. It is also home to numerous Legendary Pokémon that represent very fundamental concepts and laws of the universe. 

## History
In many of the legends of the Sinnoh people, it is said that the universe, Pokémon World included, was created by a single Pokémon, Arceus. In a Void of nothingness a single Egg came into being, which then hatched into the Origin Pokémon, the first Pokémon to come into existence. Arceus then created its first three children, Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina; the former two governed over time and space while the latter vanished to another dimension to and seized control of antimatter.

During the early formation of the Pokémon World, possibly sooner, Arceus created Azelf, Uxie, and Mesprit in order to create willpower, knowledge, and emotion respectfully, gifting these attributes to the future humans and Pokémon.  Upon their conception, they dove into the depths of present-day Lake Valor, Lake Acuity, and Lake Verity, becoming the "Lake Guardians". These three embodiments of willpower, knowledge, and emotion were also gifted with the ability to calm and control the Origin Pokemon's first children, the Creation Trio.

The next to come into being during the primal age were Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre and Rayquaza. It had been speculated that Primal Groudon was formed deep inside the earth from magma and Primal Kyogre was formed by the pressure in the deep sea, while Rayquaza was formed by the minerals of the ozone layer. Rayquaza ruled the skies, and Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre presided over the lands and sea. A chance meeting between the Continent and Sea Basin Pokémon  turned them into rivals, and a conflict for dominance over their domains began. These endless clashes that shook the Pokémon World to its core continued until Mega Rayquaza quelled it, causing Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre to retreat to their place of origin, where they rest, losing their Primal energy and forms sometime after they slumbered.



Legendaries come after what they represent, i.e. Yvetal came after death and Xerneas came after life.
