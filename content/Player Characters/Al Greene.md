## Description
Al Greene is purebred Kantoan man of twenty-five years who was a Berry Farmer until he found himself on the run from loan sharks. He is a heavily tanned man with well-defined muscles earned through endless hours working the fields of his berry farm. He has kind olive green eyes and short black hair with a nearly shaved goatee. He also wears very simple wide-brimmed straw hat, off-white button-up and blue jeans which are both comfortable and practical to his work.

Al is a very sweet person who is both kind and patient. After having lived a rough early life, he has come to appreciate many of the small things in life and prefers to come at most problems with a peaceful option if given the opportunity. He also isn’t very smart due to a lack of formal education beyond high school because of life circumstances. Nonetheless, he always tries his hardest at what he does and gives it his all.

## Goals

	- Win the Indalo Pokémon League Circuit and the sizeable prize money.

## Backstory
Al Greene lived a life as a sheep in wolf's clothes throughout his childhood and most of his young adulthood. Growing up in a shady neighborhood in the slums of Saffron City, the young boy often put up a front of being strong in order to protect himself from the bigger kids. He didn’t particularly enjoy throwing around his weight, but he did what he had to to survive. While he did have parents that should’ve been there for him, they often ignored him due their own troubles of sustaining their own lives. He was all alone.

Throughout his adolescence, people came and went. He never found anyone that he truly connected with. No one that understood the real him, or even wanted to know the real him. He found ‘friends’ in the Rabble Rousers, a gang of couriers that delivered parcels for crime syndicates in Saffron City. Yet still, he could not take off his wolf’s clothes for they were not truly his friends. He was a sheep. They were wolves. It was never going to work out.

In spite of his unfortunate circumstances in life, Al Greene was a softy at heart and very much disliked the job and industry he’d been forced into. It toyed with his mind, making himself wonder if he was a bad person when he knew deep down that he was a good guy. It made him question his morals. His existence. He wanted out. He didn’t like the criminal underworld. It liked him though. It knew Al had nowhere else to go.

The wolves feasted and the sheep grew despondent. Still, there were small mercies in Al’s life. His favorite. Berries. He had grown fond of planting small berry bushes on the small terrace of his rundown apartment. It wasn’t much, but it acted as a miniscule outlet for him to express some semblance of his neglected nurturing side; to be kind and sweet for a change. It was a lifeline. A lifeline that he was glad to latch onto for dear life.

It was on a particularly bad day that Al found himself contemplating everything that led up to this moment in life. How did he end up here? Why didn’t he do anything about it? Was he not a sheep, but a wolf? It confused and scared him. He didn’t want to be confused and scared. He hid away those thoughts and pulled out a sandwich. A berry sandwich from his own little terrace planters. It made him smile. It made him happy.

However, before he could tuck into the sandwich, a Munchlax popped its head out of a nearby dumpster and waddled over to Al. The Pokémon stared at the sandwich. They drooled. He now thought himself a wolf, but he still gave half of the sandwich to the Big Eater Pokémon. Maybe he could pretend to be a sheep? They bit into it. Their eyes lit up. They smiled.

Seeing that smile jogged some distant memory in Al’s mind. A declaration. A dream. He remembered it so vividly now. A school project. A berry tree. His parents’ smile. They never smiled. He wanted to see them smile more. He wanted to become a berry farmer. He smiled.

Tears stung at Al’s eyes as he reminisced on a dream forgotten to the ravages of time. He wanted to become a berry farmer. How could he forget? He felt the Munchlax grab his arm and saw that the Big Eater Pokémon was pointing at the other half of the sandwich. He laughed and offered it up, finding much more enjoyment from watching the Munchlax eat. He shed the wolf’s clothes. He was a sheep again.

Having realized the errors of his ways, Al wanted to pursue his childhood dream of being a berry farmer. He left the Rabble Rousers and focused on achieving his dream job. He needed Pokedollars though and would need to take out a loan. He did all the calculations despite the headaches it caused him and went to the bank to see what could be done. They refused him. He didn’t have the collateral to make such a loan.

Devastated he was, but ready to call it quits he was not. If the bank wouldn’t provide him with a loan, maybe the loan sharks he’d done deliveries for before might help? It was a path worth pursuing. Even if it was probably a bad idea. It wasn’t difficult. They all had a high opinion of him due to his prior job as a courier and were ready to give him a decent going rate for the loan he wanted. He signed without a second thought.

Now Al, he was many things, but a berry farmer he was not. Don’t get him wrong, he could handle taking care of a berry bush or two, but two hundred or three hundred? Al had severely underestimated the amount of work it takes to maintain such a large number of berry bushes. Not to mention that the Munchlax that he befriended was always just the tiniest bit too enthusiastic about taste testing the produce which made it extremely difficult to turn a profit. He wasn’t giving up though. It was his passion. His dream.

Nevertheless, Al was running out of Pokedollars and needed to take out another loan if he wanted to continue berry farming. Obviously he couldn’t reach out to the loan shark that he had yet to pay back, so he called another of his previous clients and they happily agreed to give him a loan at an appropriate rate. None the wiser to Al already being in debt with another loan shark in that very city. Surely, no one who saw the organ harvesting in the criminal underworld would be foolish enough to not pay off their debt. Right?

Even while falling further into debt, Al was truly enjoying himself for the first time. The work was fulfilling and having a friend at his side was a novel experience that he enjoyed very much. It was everything his big heart ever wanted and more. He was truly happy.

Alas, he was still incapable of turning a profit and took out another loan with a different loan shark. Again and again and again. And eventually, word got around the loan sharks in Saffron City. They were not pleased. In fact, it was probably the first time that they all worked together ever, and it was to deal with Al himself. They sent thugs after his farm, burning down the berry bushes and breaking the furniture and windows of the house. They meant business and they damn well made sure Al knew it.

It was a reality check for Al, and he quickly extracted himself from the dreamland he’d concocted around himself, Munchlax and his little farm. These loan sharks were dangerous. They were very much capable of making people disappear overnight without a trace. If he didn’t pay them back, they would chase him to the ends of the Pokémon world to get their Pokedollars back. The farm was now nothing more than a plot of land and it would take much too long to get it to a point of being operable, but what could he do?

Whether it was divine intervention, or just a happenstance of coincidence, the broken television in his now run down house turned on and garbled out some sort of news about a massive prize pool for winning the Zircon Conference at the end of the year of the Indalo League circuit. Desperate as he was, Al chose to hedge everything on this opportunity and booked a flight to Indalo with his partner, Munchlax.
