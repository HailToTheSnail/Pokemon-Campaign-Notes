## Descriptions and Details
- Indalo Map: (60% Zoom)
	- Welcome to the Indalo Region. A beautiful expanse of land and sea that converges together to bring about a world of spectacular sights and an abundant culture. From the freezing peaks of The Dragon's Spine to the treacherous depths of the Inviron Trench. The wonderful culture of the Indalo people and the diverse history of their divine ancestry. Rich with a diverse collection of Pokémon both common and rare that surpass the numbers seen in other regions, Indalo is quickly becoming an international competitive Pokémon battling hub that is hosting its largest Pokémon League circuit. Secrets abundant and prophecies foretold, this region holds a great deal of adventure for those that choose to explore it. And if you do choose to embark on this journey, there are many different aspects of an adventure you can hope to accomplish; challenging the Gym Leaders of the region, enjoying Pokémon contests, and overall seeing the sights of the world. So go forth into the Pokémon World and spin your own legend! A world of dreams and adventures with Pokémon awaits! Let's go!
- Solet Town: (60% Zoom)
	- With the start of the Indalo Pokémon League circuit starting up, the three of you have decided for one reason or another to participate, in hopes of fame or glory or whatever other shit you wish from the competition. 
	- Standing at one end of the small town of Solet Town, you notice how lush and full of rich wild flora the small community is. There are large oak trees surrounding the entire town with small houses spaced sparsely throughout and the most prominent buildings being a relatively large restaurant and the Professor's Lab that you were heading towards for a Pokédex, having already gotten your license sometime in your past. Many of the lively citizens of Solet Town are out and going about their day in relative peace. They greet you with warm smiles and friendly waves.
	- (Give players a chance to speak with each other.)
	- Having introduced yourselves to one another, you remember the fact that Professor Stephen has invited you to his lab in hopes that you'd help fill in the Pokédex while traveling the Indalo region for the Indalo Pokémon League circuit.
- Café Solet: (75% Zoom)
	- Walking into the restaurant establishment, the first thing you notice is how comfortable it is. It's not absurdly warm or way too cold. It hits that nice sweet spot that reminds you of home; whatever home is? It's relatively large for a place with a tall ceiling of bright light fixtures, seven small tables for customers and a bar near the back that can seat another eight. There's a small door off to the back leading to an enclosed space that's most likely where the kitchen is. There's also a few people standing near the side playing what looks to be an accordion, a piano keyboard, and a flute. Odd instruments for a band, but who are you to tell them what they can and cannot do.
		- News Headline on TV:
			- "Breaking news! This just in, Gym Leader Melina has aided in a police raid on a known Hoenn Mafioso hideout in Taioh City. She is personally responsible for the capture of two important members of the syndicate who will be interrogated and tried for their crimes. This is proof that Melina is more than just a pretty face and the rightfully Gym Leader of Taioh City."
			- "Onto other news, Champion Cadence has just come out of parliament with another win under his belt. The government bill he set into motion, Bill I-129, introduces the development of 100,000 rent-controlled homes across the Indalo region over eight years. At least 35,000 of those units are to be affordable, with at least 11,500 of those units being rent-geared-to income units on region-owned land. This is another huge victory for the citizens of Indalo who continue to view Champion Cadence as the 'Hero of the People'."

- Professor's Lab: (75% Zoom)
	- Entering into the Professor's Lab, you're immediately hit by the smell of science. You don't really have a proper idea of what science smells like but it just feels right to say that. The walls are lined with scientific gear that you don't even know the names of as well as papers scattered across the gear and tables. You notice the hectic frenzy the lab is in with the hustle and bustle of researchers moving around the room. And while chaotic at first, you notice that it's fairly organized and therefore fairly normal of these people. However, this isn't the reason you're here. And you set your sights on the back of the laboratory where you see two people with wildly drastic appearances than the rest of the science rabble here.
	- The first is a tall man with long black hair styled like waving flames. He's wearing a simple blue collared shirt under a white lab coat, black jeans and black runners. A little different from the normal appearance and wear you'd see a proper professor wearing, but it was a lot more tame compared to the girl standing next to him. Her hair was a bright orange with small star adornments sprinkled within. She had black sunglasses tinted red resting on the top of her head. She is wearing a turquoise tank top under her own white lab coat, sky blue jeans, and turquoise boots.
