- N/A

## Descriptions and Details
- Liyue River: (50% Zoom)
    - As you near the end of Route 1, you hear the crashing of choppy water and emerge from the tree line to see a large river that's at least twenty-five feet in width. While not exactly violent, it still seems extremely hard to cross by swimming alone. Maybe a strong swimmer could, but it'd still be dangerous. What really draws your attention though is the relatively new wooden bridge that travels the width of the river. It is held up by four large wooden stakes with two ropes attached from both stakes on one side of the river to the two stake on the other side of the river. There are also supporting ropes traveling from the the length of the main rope down to the wooden planks below. While it reminds you of every unsafe bridge that has been crossed high up in mountains in the movies, it looks far more structurally safe than those ones.
- Alcon Dam:
	- After climbing a kilometer up river, you notice a large concrete dam in the distance with a roaring flood of water flowing from large open gates near the top of the structure. Between the loud crashing of water and the humming of generators, it's hard to hear your own thoughts. It's the Alcon Dam.
		- Roll History: (Success: 12) - The Alcon Dam was an innovation of technology that redefined sustainable energy when it was first introduced. Although a little outdated, with Alcon Industries having found far better solutions to global warming, the Alcon Dam still provides a sizeable portion of the Indalo Region's energy, only overcome by places such as Eco City itself.

## Notes
- Kurisu leads Al and Mimi to the Alcon Dam where they are turned down from entry because its been closed off to the public since the Avatar Bridge had been rebuilt a year ago. 
- Kurisu talks with one of the security guards, Charles, who he'd done a stream with before and has KBBQ and hotpot with. Kurisu gives Charles $5 for the information about the bridge and being himself.
- The party see Benjamin from afar at the Avatar Bridge, who tells them that they can cross for $200, but upon seeing Kurisu, he ups the toll to $999. 
- When the party is shocked by the price and tries to cross the bridge without paying, Benjamin shows a document of ownership of the Avatar Bridge. 
- Mimi starts to film the whole ordeal but Benjamin is extremely persuasive and turns Chat against Kurisu, save for the Gen 9 babies. He vilifies himself by being blunt and abrasive and getting all up in Benjamin's face.
- Upon closer inspection of Benjamin, Al and Kurisu see that he is extremely confident in his document and head back to Charles to try and head across there again since Benjamin is being unreasonable with the toll pricing of the bridge.
- Kurisu tries to get Squirtle to attack Benjamin, but Squirtle's Thieves Code of Honor prevents him from doing so.
- When they return to the Alcon Dam, Charles tells them that the bridge is public property and that this Benjamin could not have ownership over it. 
- Charles goes with the party to the Avatar Bridge and exposes Benjamin for lying about ownership of the bridge.
- Mimi starts filming the entire thing. However, when Benjamin is exposed and is down, Kurisu goes up to Ben and spits on him, telling him how terrible he is.
- Ben snaps and rips off his clothes, revealing a Nickit suit underneath. They're then ambushed by a group of Nickit and prepare for battle.
- Charles chucks two Nickit into the river and Squirtle decides to save them because of his Thieves Code of Honor.
- Al punches Kurisu in the face to knock him out when Al threw Ben off the bridge. While Ben was hanging on, Kurisu was throwing insults at him.
- Ben befriends Al before throwing himself off the bridge. "Maybe in another world, we could've been friends. Thank you, Al. I am one with nature."
- Al technically killed Ben by pushing him off the bridge in the first place. He gets this far-away look, thinking back to his days in the underworld.
- At the end of the battle, the party earns 600 EXP (200 EXP each) from the battle. The party scanned Nickit.
- Nickit #2 runs off after thinking Benjamin killed himself.
- Party finds in Benjamin's Nickit Burrow $900, 2 Greatballs, and an Everstone
- Charles butchers the Nickit and turn them into a hotpot meat with his expert cooking prep skills. Al congratulates Leon for listening to him and doing a good job.
- Michaela meets a Gastly who licks her face and paralyzes her, laughing before disappearing.
