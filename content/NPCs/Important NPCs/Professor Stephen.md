## Description
Stephen Ironwood (29) is a former Champion-Level trainer that competed in the Indalo Circuit. Inspired by his childhood hero, Professor Oak, Stephen stepped away from his promising trainer career and pursued the world of science. At first, his research was often ridiculed by his fellow peers since they found his ideas too abstract and progressive. However, his misfortune changed when Professor Oak found his research inspiring and helped him publish a paper on his hypothesis of a new typing: the Fairy-Type. Since then, Stephen has been acknowledged by the Association of Scientific Findings and has taken up the mantle as the regional Pokémon Professor of the Indalo region. Now he spends his days studying Pokemon-Types and why they effect each other the way they do.
