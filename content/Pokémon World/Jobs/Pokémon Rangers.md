The Pokémon Rangers are a branch of law enforcement created following the chaos of the Great Pokémon War between Kanto and Johto. They are the peacekeeping militia of the Pokémon Association whose numbers are largely made up of former trainers from across all the regions associated with the organization. The Pokémon Rangers work tirelessly to accomplish the Pokémon Association's goals of ensuring the safety of humans and Pokémon, and keeping the peace between the regions.

The duties of a Pokémon Ranger are diverse and can range from anything such as ensuring the safety of the Routes to protecting Pokémon from poachers to investigating ongoing criminal cases. Amongst themselves are rangers who excel in specific fields, such as eliminating targets, and search and rescue. These specialists are divided into three divisions: 

- General Rangers - The rangers of the general division don't have any particular specialties and are usually stationed at checkpoints along the major Routes of every region associated with the Pokémon Association.
- Rescue Rangers - The rescue division of the Pokémon Rangers are specialized in rescue operations, no matter if the objective is human or Pokémon. 
- Enforcer Rangers - 

The duties of a Pokémon Ranger are varied and extensive, ranging from ensuring the safety of the Routes to protecting Pokémon from poachers to investigating ongoing criminal cases. However, in any case, a Pokémon Ranger can always be counted on to have the best interest of humans and Pokémon in mind.

While many Pokémon Rangers choose to train their own Pokémon to accomplish their peacekeeping duties, some Rangers find the use of a Poké Ball hinders their connection to Pokémon and use a device known as a Capture Styler instead. This makes it so that a Pokémon Ranger doesn't require their own Pokémon, and can instead, befriend nearby wild Pokémon to accomplish their mission objectives.

## Uniform:
Pokémon Ranger uniforms vary from region to region, each variety of uniform tailored to suit the climate their peacekeeping duties occupy. The standard uniform

- Dry - 
- Continental - 
- Polar - 
- Temperate - 
- Tropical - 
However, the two things that are universal across all uniforms are that they are red and black, and have the Pokémon Association logo emblazoned proudly across the back of the jacket.


## Capture Stylers:
The Capture Styler is a sophisticated piece of technology developed by Professor Hastings to be used in the field to calm and befriend Pokémon. This device is a highly advanced remote-controller that ejects a spinning top-like device called a Capture Disc. As the Capture Disc of the Styler loops around a wild Pokémon, it leaves a trail of beams that transmit calming waves that pacify it.
