## Description
Squirtle is the first Pokémon that Kurisu befriended at the start of his Pokémon journey two years ago. The Tiny Turtle Pokémon is a small reptile that resembles a light-blue turtle. While he typically walks on his two stubby legs, Squirtle is capable of running on all fours if needed. He has large purple eyes behind his triangular shades and a small beak. Each of Squirtle's hands and feet have three pointed digits and a long tail that curls inwards like a squirrel. His body is also encased in a tough light-brown and pale yellow shell with a white ridge between the two that formed after birth.

After having donned his iconic stolen shades, Squirtle has become the coolest of his kind. No one is capable of matching his coolness. Yet, despite how cool he has become, it has not affected how loyal and kind he is to those he cares about, fighting with all his strength to protect them. Squirtle is extremely determined and never lets anything keep him down for long, inspiring others to accomplish greatness. He is also a certified kleptomaniac and will swipe anything that he can get his claws on.

## Notes
- Squirtle lives by the Thieves Code of Honor:
	1. Don't get caught - Always remain undetected, never get caught.
	2. Never kill indiscriminately - Unless your life is being threatened, never kill a person or Pokémon. Taking a life should never be a necessary factor of any plan.
	3. Don't steal from a fellow thief - If you come across a fellow thief or their stash, do not take what you wouldn't want taken from you.
	4. Secrecy leads to longevity - Never share your trade secrets unless it is to pass down the knowledge to an apprentice or a fellow disciple.
	5. Never interfere - A thief never interferes in the score of another thief, unless asked for assistance and proper terms and compensations are set.
	6. No stealing from the poor - Do not take from those that have little to give. Be kind to the poor and they will return the favor in kind.
- At any time anything precious is within grabbing reach, Squirtle will attempt to pocket the shiny object.
