Providence is a cabal of corporate kingmakers run by three old family dynasties, known collectively as "the Partners". Pooling their vast wealth and resources over several decades, the Partners have patiently inserted loyal operatives into key positions of power inside the world's largest corporations, creating a shadow empire of unprecedented global reach and influence, while keeping its existence perfectly hidden.

Providence had no plan or ambitions beyond protecting its interests and preserving the global status qui. The Partners won a long time ago and to them, everything they do is simply maintenance. 

However, in recent years, with the discovery of the Indalo Region, Providence has unearthed new information that mentions a weapon of mass destruction of the same caliber of the now defunct Ultimate Weapon of the Kalos region. With a new goal and a promise of total control of the Pokémon World, Providence has stirred once again.
