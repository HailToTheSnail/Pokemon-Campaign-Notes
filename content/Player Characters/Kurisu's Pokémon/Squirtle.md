## Description
Squirtle is the first Pokémon that Kurisu befriended at the start of his Pokémon journey two years ago. The Tiny Turtle Pokémon is a small reptile that resembles a light-blue turtle. While he typically walks on his two stubby legs, Squirtle is capable of running on all fours if needed. He has large purple eyes behind his triangular shades and a small beak. Each of Squirtle's hands and feet have three pointed digits and a long tail that curls inwards like a squirrel. His body is also encased in a tough light-brown and pale yellow shell with a white ridge between the two that formed after birth.

After having donned his iconic stolen shades, Squirtle has become the coolest of his kind. No one is capable of matching his coolness. Yet, despite how cool he has become, it has not affected how loyal and kind he is to those he cares about, fighting with all his strength to protect them. Squirtle is extremely determined and never lets anything keep him down for long, inspiring others to accomplish greatness. He is also a certified kleptomaniac and will swipe anything that he can get his claws on.
